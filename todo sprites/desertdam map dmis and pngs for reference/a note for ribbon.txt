collections should be arranged in rows of three- you can use the "curbed" river edges to lead them to the main river as well.  collectors can be arranged 2 per as well, syphon off one of the collectors for the majigaku process.

Process:

Collection [repair the corroded pipe]

Syphon to biomass filter > start majigaku process [which is its own thing, ending with the power distribution node]

Coagulation

flacculation

Sedementation

filtration

disinfection

distribution [must be repaired from corroded]

If the process isnt done right, it will continue to emit toxic water instead.

If the water is clean on the collectors, the collectors collect and refine clean water- hence the clean options provided for coagulation, flacculation, and collectors

I have also provided the majigaku sprites, rusty grate, and a console.  the rusty grate is for posterity, because the sprites used are actually different.  assemble the DMI's like the pngs i sent
