			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Jeser updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Clicking alive xenomorphs with empty hand on GRAB intent as a human won't result in attempt to grab xenomorph and getting stunned. Yautja and Synths are unchanged. CTRL + Clicking is unchanged.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Clicking yourself with empty hand on DISARM or GRAB intents as a human will check yourself for injuries now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Point Blanks trigger only on HARM intent now.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">TheDonkified updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Middle mouse click will now allow you to give items to other humans as a human.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Middle mouse click will now allow you to climb climbable structures (window frames, tables, etc).</li>
				<li class="tweak">MMB hand swapping is still in, just don't click on a human or structure object that is right next to you. Xenos that use MMB for abilities will be able to use MMB climbing as long as you do not have an ability toggled on.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added a pref for automatic punctuation.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">ThePiachu updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Overhauled internal logic of how power is handled.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a garbage collector to the game. It's basically a background process that will periodically delete junk items from the game to hopefully lower late game lag. The items removed shouldn't affect the gameplay - burnt out flares, empty boxes, spent casings, literal garbage, etc. It won't remove items from your inventory in case you want to hold onto something specifically, and it won't instantly delete newly created garbage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added boxes of MREs and flares, so that Requisitions won't have to send them down in backpacks. Sprites by Triiodine.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed Requisitions crates to use those boxes instead of the loose items.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed Large Supply Crates to do the same (you can find one in Requisitions!).</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed weapon-specific skills (pistols, shotguns, SMGs, etc.) - they were too redundant.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed the Survival skill - it was only used to gate one recipe - molotov cocktail. Now everyone can make those! Just use paper on a bottle of something flammable.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Squished a lot of skill levels down to just a handful. They most often fall under "untrained / basic training (mini-kits) / trained (combat engis, combat medics, OTs, doctors, etc.)". Cut down on snowflake levels for singular roles, like Researchers being worse at surgery, or CEs being better at powerloader.</li>
				<li class="tweak">POs' Powerloader skill has been buffed. The only people with a mid-range powerloader skill are planned to be PFCs after reading a special pamphlet (not in a kit form, but found on colonies around powerloaders).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Some timers have been rebalanced based on the skill changes (like surgery).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Dual-wielding SMGs now has a higher scatter than before (due to removing snowflake SMG skill check).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Shipside Synths will have a new role to play in this new skill system. They will be more efficient at tasks with timers than even the specialised roles. This will mean they can prop up an entire department by themselves, so it will be up to the Command to apply them to the right place. Survivor Synthetics are not as well trained - they are only as good as a single trained individual, but still have the variety of skills to apply themselves anywhere.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Company has recently launched a colony diversity initiative! Not only will the Weston-Yamada colonies not be staffed by clones, they will have actual names and distinct features!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed the corpse spawner system to use Select Equipment system for loading gear, generating names, appearances, etc. This means the generated colonists will appear more varied.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The new USCM protocols have established that walking is now prohibited. All personel must either run or stand still, no inbetween! This extends to every person and creature in the area of operation, civilian or extraterrestrial. (Removed walk intent, it wasn't used anyway, now you will always be running and now have to worry about fat fingering walking intent and dying because of it).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Made WO compile again.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Motion detectors should properly disable themselves when a mob dies, gets hugged, gets buckled into a nest, etc.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Retrieve corpses objectives should display how many points they earn you, not only their completion percentage.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed some unused infrared sight from xenos (we don't use it anyway, it's a whole other BYOND feature).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed some null error around holsters.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Dead people's headsets disable themselves automatically. This is for performance reasons. The radios don't disable themselves when you get hugged or nested, so you can preserve that gameplay. To re-enable the headset, just open its menu, it will turn itself on automatically. Hopefully this will improve late-game performance, not having to send messages to 100+ corpses...</li>

			<h3 class="author">Vampmare updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Reduced gun + bayonet damage to slightly below machete level.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Vicacrov updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the hivelord's thick resin door's health. It is now actually stronger than a drone's door. (12052)</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the CMP's ID color. It's now silver as with all commissioned officers'. (11879)</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the Queen not being able to build nests. (12277)</li>
				<li class="tweak">The type of the two roundstart OB warheads are now random. You can start with 2 HEs, 2 incediaries, 2 clusters or any of their variations. The number of warheads did not change. (12101)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">thepiachu updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="maptweak">CORSAT's door access has been tweaked a bit to focus more on civilian access. Core buttons should still work for Marines not to derail the flow of the map.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">10 June 2020</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Atebite updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="experiment">Added a round recorder that tracks player movements and other basic information throughout the round.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Awan updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">You can eat food with the z key now. (If you enabled hotkey mode.)</li>
				<li class="tweak">Using Thwei on humans is fixed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Fax machines have department tags now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Brig has a crew monitor</li>
				<li class="tweak">SEA has a fax machine now.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Awantje updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">removes hpc damage</li>
				<li class="tweak">Lets hpc be targeted instead of being max range always</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Neth updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Added new ability to Shaman Carrier "Remember Pain(300)". This lets you remember amount of xenos near you (non-shaman, expends egg). When you use any other ability, if amount of xenos around you is less than amount you remembered, you will cast your next ability at remembered power and reset the remembered count.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">ThePiachu updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">1st generation synths have been sped up to their later gen counterparts.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Synth self-repair has been sped up.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed DEFCON trigger levels to absolute numbers, rather than percentages. This means you shouldn't see DEFCON percentages go down unless you are really sabotaging yourself. This should also make maps with a lot of civilian corpses less of a grind.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Survivors are worth less intel points now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Xeno containment and corpses are worth different amount of points based on their tier. T1 is worth less than before, T3 is worth more, etc.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Intel scanner now points out data terminals. This will help you locate them in unfamiliar maps.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a new skill to the game - Reading and Comprehension. It's a skill that speeds up processing intel. IOs and all other officers have this skill at an advanced level, cutting down their intel processing time by 25%. There is also an expert level of this skill (which will be available to IOs at a later date once vendor changes come in) to cut down the processing time by 50%.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Mini Intel kits come with a basic reading pamphlet to bring the reader to the level of an IO.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Borg recharge stations now repair synths and borgs.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added objective landmarks to Trijent Dam.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tweaked Solaris Ridge's objective landmarks.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added objective landmarks to Sorokyne Strata.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Upped the DEFCON level requirements for LV.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When fultoned objects drop to the ground they create a new objective - retrieve lost fulton. It is worth zero points, but it's a useful way for IOs to track lost intel crates.</li>
				<li class="tweak">When the nuclear bomb is turned off, its timer resets to full - Marines have to commit to detonating it and not hold the enemies hostage at 30 seconds pause.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a command lockout to the bomb. If engaged by the command staff (anyone with Bridge access), it makes it so only command staff can toggle safety and toggle the timer. This is to limit potential griefing with the bomb timer.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Egg Morpher can now store 12 huggers. Each corpse still produces 6 huggers.</li>
				<li class="tweak">When Egg Morpher is destroyed it spawns some of its huggers around itself, like a dying Carrier.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Survivor synthetic now has access to Research by default (since they are WY property, and to help on CORSAT access)</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reading pamphlets are not a bit less patronising.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Paper objectives now get a small pixel offset.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Progress Reports and Technical Manuals are now a bit faster to read, especially the latter.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed some runtime errors around smartpacks, defibs, xeno hives, etc.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed MPs not being able to use some MP lockers.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Intel scanners can now detect detatched synth heads.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Crypod logs now list an area name rather than floor name.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Solaris Ridge DEFCON level triggers have been made harder to complete.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reduced the amount of unnecessary processing for idle airlocks, disposal units and computers. This should hopefully have some positive effect on lag, especially on large station maps.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed double inits of carpets, some other floors and paralysis pen.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Hopefully fixed some other null runtime error.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Triiodine's sprite to the reading pamphlet.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Vials get a small pixel offset.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">TobiNerd updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Research can now transmit chemical data to the central WY database. This will make that chem exist in the following round, although with a new recipe, name and clearance level. The new clearance level and transmisison cost is based off the properties of the chem, whereas negative and neutral properties lower the cost.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The CL can now print research grants containing 4 research credits for 30 briefcase points.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The CL can now print a chemical report for a new unique chemical at the cost of 50 briefcase points. The level of this chemical will be equal to the current clearance level of the research department.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Research publications can be viewed when wearing a Healthmate HUD.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The CMO now spawns with a level 2 chemical report in their labcoat.</li>
				<li class="tweak">All papers can now be added to the research database by clicking a research terminal with the paper. This means you can make your own hand-written publications!</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now read papers from the research database without printing them.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Doubled the strength of the painkilling chemical property. Standard painkillers have had their property levels adjusted accordingly.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cryometabolizing now acts as a booster to other properties for half its own level. The levels of other properties in cryoxadone and clonexadone have been lowered to represent the same healing result with the boost. #11636 by Watermelon914.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Research now starts with 2 credits instead of 1.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added a filing cabinet to the CMO office.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed hyposprays that spawn empty not having a vial inside.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You can no longer target chems with no recipe in the synthesis simulator, such as elementary particles.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed chem transmitted to the next round not loading properties correctly.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Research chem transmission cost is now minimum 3 credits. WY won't buy your garbage anymore.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed M39 brace offset issues.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">You can no longer wear health analyzers, magazines, grenades, ammunition handfuls, and binoculars on M3 pattern armor suit slots. Unfortunately there's no clean way to change the storage priority for just these items. #8735, #9349.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the missing sec-glasses mask icon.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the M44 Custom having worse one handed accuracy, when it should've had superior accuracy.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Removed access to the not-so-secret developer credits room on Sorokyne. You can still ghost over and look at it though.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the cold water tile blocker that wasn't actually over cold water on Sorokyne.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You can no longer tunnel into the dev credits room on Sorokyne.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Expanded the tunnel restriction zone down by Glubs on Sorokyne.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Base Ravager Ability #2: Scissor Cut. Deal light damage to targets in a 1x4 line in front of you. If you have more than 150 shield, the ability dazes.</li>

				<li class="rscdel">Removed Veteran Ravager.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Berserker Ability #1: Apprehend. Pick a human target. If you are still within 6 tiles of them after 1 second, pull yourself to them.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Praetorian stat changes: removed pheromones, slightly increased slash damage, increased health, increased explosive armor.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Base Praetorian Passive: Corrosive Acid. Your acid-based abilities apply a stack of acid to your enemies. When a target has 3 stacks and is slashed, the acid stacks are expended, dealing damage.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Vanguard Praetorian Ability #2: Dash. Charge through enemies to travel at most 4 tiles. You can reactivate the ability immediately after dashing to damage targets in a 3x3 grid around you. This also recharges your shield if it hits at least 2 targets.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Dancer Praetorian stat changes: Lower armor, increased speed and evasion, lower damage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Dancer Praetorian Passive: Finesse. For a short time after slashing a marine, you have increased evasion. Hitting a marine with a slash applies a tag used by your other abilities. Missing a click with your offensive abilities adds a short cooldown.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Dancer Praetorian Active #1: Impale. Attack a marine with your tail. Notable change from prev.: does NOT work over cades and has a 1-tile range. If the marine is tagged, stab twice instead.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Boiler Active #1: Bombard. Target an area you can see. After a delay, launch an unblockable and perfectly accurate acid bomb at that location. The bomb deals guaranteed acid damage and leaves behind a cloud of toxic gas.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Boiler Active #2: Acid Lance. Start charging the ability by activating it once. While charging, progressively lose movespeed. Fire the ability by activating it a second time; the range and damage are proportional to the amount of time spent charging.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Trapper is designed to be a glass cannon zone controller and powerful siege engine.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Trapper Active #1: Resin Trap. You place a line of 5 traps orthogonal to yourself. Traps last 10 seconds and root targets that fall into them for 2.5 seconds.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Lurker Active #2: Invisibility. Makes you invisible for a maximum of 30 seconds. While invisible, your speed is increased and is further increased by the distance between you and your nearest ally (maximized at 40 tiles).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Offensive actions, like pouncing and slashing, cancel your invisibility.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Your cooldown starts after your invisibility ends one way or another, and is always 15 seconds long.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Removed default round start buff to upgrade and evolution for xenos</li>
				<li class="tweak">Evolution and Upgrade speed is now tied to number of xenos (more xenos, less upgrade), marines (more marines, more upgrade) and time (more time, more upgrade). To top it off, it is all finally related to number of Larva. If you have no larva, this bonus is not applied. The more larva you have, the proportionally more upgrade speed you will have. These effects are active only when queen is in ovipositor or first few minutes of the round.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Example, 100 marines, 10 xenos and 30 larva. Boost is 6.5x for the first ten minutes then it goes to 13x if NO XENOS JOIN after 40 minutes. If xenos keep joining as larva numbers lower, it will taper down, it will be about 1x when there are no larva left.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Returned basic increase for first 30 minutes for upgrade level and evolution. Now it's a maximum of two systems, whatever is bigger will be applied.</li>
