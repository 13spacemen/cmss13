				<li class="tweak">Shrapnel has been changed. If humans move while embedded, they will recieve brute damage to a body part. It is suggested they get rid of shrapnel fast.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Marines can now use their boot knife to remove shrapnel. Press Z in hotkey mode to use it and the equivalent in normal mode.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Vampmare & Triiodine updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Handrails, railings, etc now exist. They can be vaulted, reinforced, and melted. They cannot be wired or repaired, even when reinforced. Handrails provide minimal projectile cover.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Handrails can be constructed for two metal. They can be reinforced to provide cover and block hostile movement for one metal sheet. Use a welder to secure the reinforcing plate. Use a crowbar to remove it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Handrails can be unsecured and moved with a wrench. Use a screwdriver to deconstruct an unsecured handrail into metal sheets.</li>

The Broiler-T can be refueled by placing incinerator unit tanks into it. The current tank will be swapped out for the fresh one. The active fuel tank/type is visible as a HUD button in upper left. Pressing it will cycle M240-T munition type. The M240-T can also be stored inside the Broiler-T back harness, but it won't work with the auto-equip.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed reagent containers showing reagent id instead of name on examine.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed some runtimes regarding catalysts.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed oxycodone being no stronger than tramadol. Damn those budget cuts...</li>
				<li class="bugfix">CL Can no longer use the chem dispenser.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased researcher slots from 1 to 2 during lowpop and 2 to 3 during highpop.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The surgery skill has been divided into 4 levels instead of 2. Surgery speed of everyone is unaffected by this except for:</li>
				<li class="tweak">Researchers are now slightly slower at surgery than doctors to emphasize the role getting more purpose.</li>
				<li class="tweak">1st generation synths are now slightly faster at surgery than doctors. Other synth generations remain at CMO speed.</li>

				<li class="tweak">In paperformatting, you can now use [uscm] to make a USCM logo or [wy] for a company logo. [logo] still works so you don't have to redo all your templates.</li>
				<li class="experiment">CHEMICAL RESEARCH UPDATE</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a random chemical generator to CM. This can generate random chemicals with millions of combinations for properties, recipes, names and other stats.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Every round, a specific amount of these chemicals will be generated. It is up to the researchers to discover these chemicals and unlock their potential.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Generated chemicals can have between 1-4 properties of varying potency, all of which can be any combination of good and bad. Discovering these will require thorough testing.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The recipe for all generated chemicals require 3 different components, and maybe an additional catalyst. The components can be anything from iron to souto or even plasma from an alien...</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Chemicals with a higher number of properties tend to require more rare components. These may not be something you can get normally. You'll thus have to either retrieve a sample of it from the colony or by using hydroponics.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mutating plants in hydroponics now has a chance to make the plant contain a new chemical. This can also be one of the randomly generated chemicals.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">An XRF Scanner has been added to Almayer research. Those trained in research can use this to analyze the composition of a chemical sample.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Chemicals scanned by the XRF might be something it can't identify. This means you have to obtain a sample of this first and scan that.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Identifying a new chemical will give DEFCON, with more points from rare ones. You know this when the XRF prints: Saved emission spectrum of...</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Note: The XRF does not analyze the properties of a chemical. But will print any infomation it might have in its database.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Updated the description of most chemicals to fit better with the XRF. Not like you could see the descriptions before anyway...</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The medical computer can now print scan records onto paper.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Research notes describing the random chemicals can now be found around research and administrative areas around maps.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Vial boxes with random chemicals can now be found in research areas around maps.</li>
				<li class="wip">The above two items have yet to be added to Trijent Dam, as the map is currently undergoing some major changes. But will be added at a later date.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Researchers now spawn with a random research note. However, this note will only describe one of the simple chemicals. So it is just to get you started.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Scientist survivors now spawn with a random vial and a research note. Unlike the researcher's, this can be the good stuff too.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Pistol Rework Commenced.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Pistols have the same accuracy when wielded and when one-handed. Akimbo unaffected.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Mod 88 also known as 88M4 has become one of three main marine pistols. It is the opposite of M4A3, so it has capacity, armour penetration and a three round burst.</li>
				<li class="tweak">M44 Revolver remains a main gun, but it has been reworked. Using a speedloader magazine on a revolver will make it function as a normal reload. If there are leftover bullets in when using the speedloader, they will be dumped on the ground.</li>
				<li class="tweak">M44 Revolver ammo has changed. Normal: high damage, a little AP. Marksman: medium damage, decent ap and no damage falloff. Heavy: medium damage, low AP and a weaker version of slug effect.</li>
				<li class="tweak">VP78 has replaced Mod 88 in the Self-Defense kit, spec kits and XO belt. The stats have been buffed to be in line with a primary weapon. More damage, more AP.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Increased the slots in the mateba belt and smartpistol belt by one.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Some actions can now be performed one-handed, like building cades, wiring cades, splinting, applying kits, placing claymores and repairing cades. The intended use is to use a pistol in the other hand.</li>
				<li class="tweak">M44 Revolver stock has been changed. It can now be folded to fit in a belt holster or your belt slot, but it cannot fire folded. The stats are the same.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Holsters now care about stocks again.</li>
