				<li class="tweak">Tail sweep and spin slash macros have been turned into toggle macros.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the TC-4T portable telecommunications kit to the Almayer, found in the hangar south of the Alamo.

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed reagent containers showing reagent id instead of name on examine.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed some runtimes regarding catalysts.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed oxycodone being no stronger than tramadol. Damn those budget cuts...</li>
				<li class="bugfix">CL Can no longer use the chem dispenser.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased researcher slots from 1 to 2 during lowpop and 2 to 3 during highpop.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The surgery skill has been divided into 4 levels instead of 2. Surgery speed of everyone is unaffected by this except for:</li>
				<li class="tweak">Researchers are now slightly slower at surgery than doctors to emphasize the role getting more purpose.</li>
				<li class="tweak">1st generation synths are now slightly faster at surgery than doctors. Other synth generations remain at CMO speed.</li>

				<li class="tweak">In paperformatting, you can now use [uscm] to make a USCM logo or [wy] for a company logo. [logo] still works so you don't have to redo all your templates.</li>
				<li class="experiment">CHEMICAL RESEARCH UPDATE</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a random chemical generator to CM. This can generate random chemicals with millions of combinations for properties, recipes, names and other stats.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Every round, a specific amount of these chemicals will be generated. It is up to the researchers to discover these chemicals and unlock their potential.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Generated chemicals can have between 1-4 properties of varying potency, all of which can be any combination of good and bad. Discovering these will require thorough testing.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The recipe for all generated chemicals require 3 different components, and maybe an additional catalyst. The components can be anything from iron to souto or even plasma from an alien...</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Chemicals with a higher number of properties tend to require more rare components. These may not be something you can get normally. You'll thus have to either retrieve a sample of it from the colony or by using hydroponics.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mutating plants in hydroponics now has a chance to make the plant contain a new chemical. This can also be one of the randomly generated chemicals.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">An XRF Scanner has been added to Almayer research. Those trained in research can use this to analyze the composition of a chemical sample.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Chemicals scanned by the XRF might be something it can't identify. This means you have to obtain a sample of this first and scan that.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Identifying a new chemical will give DEFCON, with more points from rare ones. You know this when the XRF prints: Saved emission spectrum of...</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Note: The XRF does not analyze the properties of a chemical. But will print any infomation it might have in its database.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Updated the description of most chemicals to fit better with the XRF. Not like you could see the descriptions before anyway...</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The medical computer can now print scan records onto paper.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Research notes describing the random chemicals can now be found around research and administrative areas around maps.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Vial boxes with random chemicals can now be found in research areas around maps.</li>
				<li class="wip">The above two items have yet to be added to Trijent Dam, as the map is currently undergoing some major changes. But will be added at a later date.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Researchers now spawn with a random research note. However, this note will only describe one of the simple chemicals. So it is just to get you started.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Scientist survivors now spawn with a random vial and a research note. Unlike the researcher's, this can be the good stuff too.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed plant mutations for spreading vines and temperature tolerances.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Pistol Rework Commenced.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Pistols have the same accuracy when wielded and when one-handed. Akimbo unaffected.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Dual-wielding pistols/akimbo has been nerfed. Bullet spread has been increased and accuracy reduced in this mode.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Extended mags for M4A3 has been removed. AP and HP mags for M4A3 made scarce.</li>
				<li class="tweak">M4A3 remains a marine pistol. It offers accuracy and pure damage, in exchange for capacity and armour penetration. Buffed overall.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Mod 88 also known as 88M4 has become one of three main marine pistols. It is the opposite of M4A3, so it has capacity, armour penetration and a three round burst.</li>
				<li class="tweak">M44 Revolver remains a main gun, but it has been reworked. Using a speedloader magazine on a revolver will make it function as a normal reload. If there are leftover bullets in when using the speedloader, they will be dumped on the ground.</li>
				<li class="tweak">M44 Revolver ammo has changed. Normal: high damage, a little AP. Marksman: medium damage, decent ap and no damage falloff. Heavy: medium damage, low AP and a weaker version of slug effect.</li>
				<li class="tweak">VP78 has replaced Mod 88 in the Self-Defense kit, spec kits and XO belt. The stats have been buffed to be in line with a primary weapon. More damage, more AP.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">M44, VP78, Mod 88, Smartpistol and the Mateba have all gotten a facelift, courtesy of Triiodine.</li>
				<li class="soundadd">M44, VP78 and Mod88 have gotten new sounds, mixed by Triiodine. Give them some time before condemning them to the gates of hell.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Buffed accuracy and damage of M4A3 Custom. SOs, POs and TCs spawn with it.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Buffed damage of the smartpistol slightly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">A new kit has been added "Experimental Trooper Kit". It is the new kit to get smartpistols and everything you could need for it. It can be found in main req or your squad req.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Vendors have been changed to accommodate the above changes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Increased the slots in the mateba belt and smartpistol belt by one.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Some actions can now be performed one-handed, like building cades, wiring cades, splinting, applying kits, placing claymores and repairing cades. The intended use is to use a pistol in the other hand.</li>
				<li class="tweak">M44 Revolver stock has been changed. It can now be folded to fit in a belt holster or your belt slot, but it cannot fire folded. The stats are the same.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Holsters now care about stocks again.</li>
				<li class="tweak">New pain sound added, you may recognize the voice.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Synthetic units can now take a bit more of a beating.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">After 5 seconds, it applies a new status effect called paralyis.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Paralysis can be seen via examining a mob.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">During paralysis the patient cannot move, see, talk, or feel pain. However, they can hear everything around them and on the radio, to keep them in the loop during surgery.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Paralysed patients can be operated on with a 100% success (minus the surface penalties, of course). Use this to your advantage with lung ruptures.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Suxamorycin, being an experimental W-Y chemical, may have some... unintended side effects. Nothing permament, however.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Suxamorycin can be made by mixing chloral hydrate, oxygen, and nitrogen.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">The smartgun changes are in.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">First the smartgun now uses ammo packs instead of the ammo coming out of the powerpack.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Second the smartgun now has special firing modes that can be activated in the new smartgun tab.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The easiest modes are the anti-recoil mode, the improved accuracy mode, and the swap ammo mode.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The last two modes are the automatic firing mode and the built-in motion sensor mode.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All modes use power. The automatic firing mode uses the most.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The smartgun now has 2 loading systems both having their own drawbacks.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The classic system stayed the same. 50 round size magazine.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The new (default) mode can only be used with an empty belt slot.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">It has a 500 round magazine but when added to the gun goes into your belt slot.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">This mean you cannot use a sidearm or carry extra ammo while using this system.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Lastly, a special ERT was added.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Monkeys will now randomly pick up, drop, and throw items, as well as occasionally shoot guns.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Overhauled the accessory system to allow for multiple accessories on clothing, sorted by slot type. You can still only have 1 webbing equipped, but have multiple decorative accessories as well as medals worn at the same time.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Stats changes: Heavy speed increase in exchange for heavy armor and pheromone decrease.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Utility ability: Dance. (increase evasion and speed temporarily). Making an attack in dance cancels the stat buffs but empowers the attack.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Damage ability: Tail attack. Has two variants, both of which can be used from one tile further away than a slash: impale and abduct. Impale does direct damage and abduct applies a stun.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Both variants of tail attack are empowered like a slash when used while Dance is active. Impale deals double damage and abduct activates much faster.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Oppressor - Tank and AoE-oriented.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Stats changes: Heavy armor increase in exchange for heavy movespeed and pheromone decrease.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Damage ability: Punch. This is much like warrior's punch except that it deals significantly more damage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Utility ability: Gas Grenade. This launches a grenade like glob of acid that explodes into Neurotoxin. It bypasses barricades but has extremely limited range (5 tiles).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All Praetorian strains/archetypes now have a unique screech ability that fits their design: Base Praetorian heals nearby Xenos; Royal Guard buffs the damage of nearby Xenos; Dancer debuffs the accuracy of nearby marines; Oppressor buffs the armor of nearby Xenos.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Macro list for the new abilities: https://pastebin.com/GHkQgKTX</li>
				<li class="imageadd">All screeches have unique colors to distinguish them for allied Xenos. Base Prae = Green; Oppressor = Purple; Royal Guard = Red; Dancer = Blue.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Dev test-based changes:</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Courtesy of Triiodine, enjoy a new sprite for the Oppressor nade that isn't the marine training nade.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Nerfed activation time, cooldown, throw range, and spread distance of the Oppressor Praetorian gas grenade as well as the explosives protection of its screech.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Nerfed movespeed of Dancer praetorians, increased the cooldown of Dance, nerfed its duration.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Nerfed the caste's pheromones further.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased cooldown of Praetorian screeches accross the board.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Eliminated screenshake for Xeno players from Praetorian screech and reduced it for Marine players.</li>
