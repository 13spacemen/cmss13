				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Corsat loading Trijent instead.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Triiodine updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Reduced latency overhead on Sorokyne Strata. Keep an eye on your ping, it should be about the same as other maps now.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Made sure survivors don't spawn next to Larva on Sorokyne Strata.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Added the Clown back to Sorokyne Strata.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Larva that spawn in the Deep Jungle Security Outpost should no longer be trapped until they mature.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Tank (And eventually APC) are now enabled on Sorokyne, seeing as it is now Tank friendly. You need 100 readied players round start for it to spawn.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Greatly decongested Sorokyne Strata.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Removed nearly every platform in the way of primary combat lanes.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Increased all platform stair widths to minimum 3, with majority now being 5 wide.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added new lanes connecting Sorokyne Medical to Sorokyne Administration.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Increased the width of the lane connecting Sorokyne Medical to the Aerodrome.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Removed needless holes and platforms in the Aerodrome.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Opened up Sorokyne Engineering and added enough generators to power the whole map. Backup generators still exist and can be powered.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added some indestructable landmarks to the Sorokyne Deep Jungle, you should be getting lost a bit less.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Opened up the Personal Storage and Shower block on Sorokyne, it now connects to the North Wooden Hospital and Minehead, along with a new entrance to the Deep Jungle.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Opened up the areas around Sorokyne Administration so it's easier to navigate, or just cut past entirely.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added connecting lanes from Sorokyne Security Hall to the Northern Pass and Administration.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Opened up the lanes leading into South LZ1. More changes to LZ1 and LZ2 pending.</li>

				<li class="maptweak">Removed a lot of in-the-way walls in the Jungle that over complicated pathing. Sightlines should be clearer, and defenses for Xenos more easily constructed.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Spread out all the Xeno spawns on Sorokyne, hopefully this will encourage new hive locations. Previously all Xenos spawned in a ring in the south of the map.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Opened up ice platforms and the base lanes in the Cryo-Thermal marshes, there should be more platform options, but they're not required to navigate the area anymore.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Opened up the Deep Jungle Security Outpost so it's more hive-viable. Added some secondary flanks to its chokepoints.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added a new lane that leads into the North Passage and the Northern Basket Ball Court on Sorokyne.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added extra data-terminals and and reduced the total amount of objective items to Sorokyne, this should make DEFCON easier.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Removed all the doors cutting the Aerodrome off from the rest of the map.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added a new lane into the Canteen in the South, it leads directly to the upper decks. The previous lane was expanded, the kitchen is smaller as a result.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Widened the Administration back hall.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added a new lane between south Administration to the South Canteen hall, this connects it directly to the Aerodrome.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Removed needless platforms and railings in Sorokyne Engineering lounge and foyer, it should be much easier to navigate.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Reduced Sorokyne from 256x256 to 256x190 tiles.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Snowstorms now have to wait 20 minutes between potentially happening instead of 4.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">There are about a hundred other smaller changes, which are far too numerous to list. Happy Xeno hunting and Marine nesting.</li>

				<li class="maptweak">Widened some hallways on prison station for tank accessibility.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Removed the northeast and southeast central ring hallways on Prison Station.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">The south cell blocks on Prison have now been locked off along with civilian residencies to allow for more diverse hive locations.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Xenomorph spawns on Prison Station have been moved to southwest medium security to be able to move between potential hive spots better.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Removed the civilian hangar on Prison Station.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Added new Toggle Ghost HUDs verb, that allows you to set which HUDs you want to have ON by default when you become ghost.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Some very long preferences verbs names were made shorter.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Welcome to Proper Fireteams Part 2.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed several small bugs in Fireteams and Team Leaders assignments logic.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Marines will receive noticeable notifications upon being assigned to or unassigned from Fireteam. If Fireteam has a Team Leader assigned, TL also will receive a notification with the name of marine being assigned to or unassigned from their Fireteam.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Clicking with EMPTY hand on your SL/TL Tracker will bring up Squad Info Window. It shows important information about squad. PFCs with Technician and First Responder kits are marked with special icons in it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Acting Squad Leaders can manage Fireteams and Team Leaders remotely via Squad Info window. Use M.I.A. (Missing In Action) and K.I.A. (Killed In Action) statuses to mark unaccounted for and unrevivably dead marines. Legacy way of managing Fireteams via examining wasn't removed and still available for SLs who have problems with NanoUI.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Team Leaders are now marked in Overwatch's list of marines.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed outdated comms role assignment upon demoting aSL.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Added new nightmare variants to Big Red for filtration and lambda caves.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Nightmare functionality added to Trijent Dam. All bridges except for the north bridge can now start as being either broken, damaged or repaired. Smaller bridges in new locations also has a chance of spawning.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Neth updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Increased number of huggers that carrier can store up to 20 on ancient level.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased number of eggs that carrier can store.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed Eggsac Carrier Strain.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Shaman Carrier Strain. Shamans lose all abilities besides picking eggs up and lose ability to carry huggers. Shamans cannot be affected by pheromones, no matter the level or type.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Shamans have special abilities, all of which share following features: They have windup (delay before effect starts), they work proportionally to amount of non-Shaman xenos in radius (currently currently 3/3.5/3.75/4), they do not work on Shamans, they have common cooldown of 40/30/25/20 seconds (so if you use one ability, you can't use others for that amount of seconds), and MOST IMPORTANTLY they consume an egg to cast an ability. If there is no non-Shaman xenos near to you, effect is cancelled but resources are used.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">First Shaman ability is Adrenal Healing (100). After channeling for 2.5 seconds, Shaman affects in radius 3 all other non-Shaman xenos of their hive by giving them overhealth for 30 seconds, repairing their armor, and unstunning them. Effect is proportional to number of xenos after channeling. No more than 25% of armor integrity will be restored. Minimal effect is 10% for every, if only one other xeno was near you.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Second Shaman ability is Frenzied Scream (300). After channeling for 3 seconds, Shaman affects all xenos FROM OTHER HIVES and all humans by applying a 4 second (endurance may lower this time) knockdown and forcing humans to roll (it will extinguish fire and acid if you are lucky). The radius starts at 3 tiles from Shaman if Shaman has 1 non-Shaman xenomorph nearby, and increases by 0.5 tiles per nearby xeno, up to limit of 7. This ability cannot hit same target more than once in 20 seconds. It also won't affect recently screeched by queen targets.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Third Shaman ability is Adrenal Pheromones (300). After channeling for 2.5 seconds Shaman starts emitting ALL pheromones with effect starting at 1 (lowest level) when 1 non-Shaman xeno is nearby, and with 0.5 increase per xeno, it stops at 5 (ancient empress level). This pheromone emitting stays for 30 seconds after which it expires. Reminder: Pheromones DO NOT WORK ON SHAMANS.</li>
