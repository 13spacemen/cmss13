			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">The smartgun changes are in.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">First the smartgun now uses ammo packs instead of the ammo coming out of the powerpack.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Second the smartgun now has special firing modes that can be activated in the new smartgun tab.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The easiest modes are the anti-recoil mode, the improved accuracy mode, and the swap ammo mode.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The last two modes are the automatic firing mode and the built-in motion sensor mode.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All modes use power. The automatic firing mode uses the most.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The smartgun now has 2 loading systems both having their own drawbacks.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The classic system stayed the same. 50 round size magazine.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The new (default) mode can only be used with an empty belt slot.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">It has a 500 round magazine but when added to the gun goes into your belt slot.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">This mean you cannot use a sidearm or carry extra ammo while using this system.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Lastly, a special ERT was added.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Cakey updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Mob rendering has been overhauled. If you see anything strange, please report it on the gitlab.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Monkeys are now a subtype of human, which means they can now wear more types of clothing. Time to pla dressup monkey!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Monkeys will now randomly pick up, drop, and throw items, as well as occasionally shoot guns.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Overhauled the accessory system to allow for multiple accessories on clothing, sorted by slot type. You can still only have 1 webbing equipped, but have multiple decorative accessories as well as medals worn at the same time.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added two uniform shoulder patches to the loadout selector, the USCM patch, and the Falling Falcons patch.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added rank pins and boards, spawned on your uniforms based on rank. Can be removed with something sharp, if you want to impersonate someone else...</li>

				<li class="tweak">Increased HPR fire rate in single fire mode, especially without a bipod.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased HPR fire rate within bursts.</li>

				<li class="experiment">Added a toggle and boiler's acid line spray to Royal Guard only. This may be reverted if it proves to be too strong.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Royal Guard Praetorians now deal more melee damage than other Praetorian variants.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added 2 strains for Praetorian.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Dancer - movement and combo-focused.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Stats changes: Heavy speed increase in exchange for heavy armor and pheromone decrease.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Utility ability: Dance. (increase evasion and speed temporarily). Making an attack in dance cancels the stat buffs but empowers the attack.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Damage ability: Tail attack. Has two variants, both of which can be used from one tile further away than a slash: impale and abduct. Impale does direct damage and abduct applies a stun.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Both variants of tail attack are empowered like a slash when used while Dance is active. Impale deals double damage and abduct activates much faster.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Oppressor - Tank and AoE-oriented.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Stats changes: Heavy armor increase in exchange for heavy movespeed and pheromone decrease.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Damage ability: Punch. This is much like warrior's punch except that it deals significantly more damage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Utility ability: Gas Grenade. This launches a grenade like glob of acid that explodes into Neurotoxin. It bypasses barricades but has extremely limited range (5 tiles).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All Praetorian strains/archetypes now have a unique screech ability that fits their design: Base Praetorian heals nearby Xenos; Royal Guard buffs the damage of nearby Xenos; Dancer debuffs the accuracy of nearby marines; Oppressor buffs the armor of nearby Xenos.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Macro list for the new abilities: https://pastebin.com/GHkQgKTX</li>
				<li class="imageadd">All screeches have unique colors to distinguish them for allied Xenos. Base Prae = Green; Oppressor = Purple; Royal Guard = Red; Dancer = Blue.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Dev test-based changes:</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Courtesy of Triiodine, enjoy a new sprite for the Oppressor nade that isn't the marine training nade.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Nerfed activation time, cooldown, throw range, and spread distance of the Oppressor Praetorian gas grenade as well as the explosives protection of its screech.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Nerfed movespeed of Dancer praetorians, increased the cooldown of Dance, nerfed its duration.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Nerfed the caste's pheromones further.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased cooldown of Praetorian screeches accross the board.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Eliminated screenshake for Xeno players from Praetorian screech and reduced it for Marine players.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the issue where Praes would be spammed with messages after the effects of their screech wore off.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Buckshot stuns less, slowdowns for more time instead.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Neurotoxin has perfect accuracy now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Neurotoxin slows on first hit, slows even more on second, shell shocks on third and Knocks Down on 4th. Hits after that keep targets down as long as they are shell shocked.</li>
				<li class="tweak">If neurotoxin hits human enough times it will force sleep on them for half a minute. Every time neurotoxin hits human after that, it resets sleep back to half a minute.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Acid (except boiler) can hit xenos of a different hive. Neuro included, however it can't Stun or KO.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Stun and Shell Shock time is affected by endurance skill. This should help survivors get an upper hand.</li>
