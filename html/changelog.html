			<h3 class="author">Neth Iafins updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscdel">Removed a ton of Syndicate items. We are not affiliated with NanoTrasen in any shape or form.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Armor has now random range from hit to hit. It's not big but this is added so no damage is the same from hit to hit</li>
				<li class="tweak">Marine Armor values are completely changed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Endurance is a useful skill now. Survivors have it super trained. Endurance helps you in avoiding IB and Organ Damage. It will help with bone breaks in future but not right now.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Some rarer armors protect you immensly from certain elements (like biohazzard against xeno spit) but are terrible at everything else. Experiment but remember that MPs can arrest you for bad uniform.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Light armor protects you against spit and gives you more speed "compensation" for gun weight</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Medium armor now has 3 pockets inside and has middle armor between Light and Heavy</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Heavy armor protects against explosions, melee and bullets. It also holds your intestines together so you get IB and Organ Damage less often</li>
				<li class="tweak">Masks defend your face against spit</li>
				<li class="tweak">Damage to armor only works after 0.2 of a second pass, so if you shoot flechette or something at xeno, armor only changes after all bullets connect</li>
				<li class="tweak">There is a mechanic with armor that if person is dealt damage much less than the armor, the armor has MORE effect on that attack. Now this mechanic also takes into account current armor integrity</li>
				<li class="rscadd">IB and Organ Damage uses new "armor-damage system". "Armor Integrity" for IB and Organ Damage is your leftover health on the limb, which means that the more limb is damaged the bigger chance you have to get IB or Organ Damage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">IO Suit now has 4 pockets</li>
				<li class="tweak">Acid Spit armor penetration reduced. Acid Spit elder+ damage reduced.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tank now gets a bit more damage.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Ranged attacks deal less damage vs Metal Barricades.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reduced damage required for bone break</li>
				<li class="tweak">Bone break is no longer guaranteed but controlled by armor and endurance</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">08 June 2019</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Fourkhan updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Reworked the pain mechanic.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Acid splash changes from the dev test are reverted, but expect a more thorough change soon.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Pain is now capped by the damage you've taken, so you will never have very high pain with low damage.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Splinted limbs are much less punishing.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Movement should overall be faster for marines.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Pain should go into effect quicker at very high damage levels so while you will still have a "buffer", it will not be as large.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The pain indicator should correctly correspond to the new change.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Neth Iafin updated:</h3>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added L42 incendiary mags. They are as rare as incendiary rifle mags.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added M39 Light Explosive (LE) ammo. Does very little actual damage, but shreds armor quickly (even when it deflects). Magazines can generally be found alongside normal M39 AP ammo sources, but in smaller quantity.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The laser sight attachment now decreases wielded scatter too, and can be attached to the L42.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Severely reduced the damage falloff debuff of the recoil compensator, making it a more viable option.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Changed the miniscope sprite a little bit.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Slightly increased MAC-15 SMG fire rate to be more SMG-like, allowed attachment of laser sights, suppressors and reflex sights.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased the PPSh fire rate to be more SMG-like. It was slower than an M41...</li>
				<li class="tweak">The CZ-81 Skorpion can now fit the reflex sight, laser sight and supressor attachments. The fire rate was increased and damage lowered, magazine size increased slightly.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Slightly increased MP27 fire rate, and additionally allowed attachment of laser sights, reflex sights and mini scopes (was big scopes). Damage slightly lowered.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The MP5 can now additionally fit laser sights, extended barrels, angled grips and miniscopes instead of normal scopes.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The UPP Type 71 and 71c can now fit reflex sights, red dot sights, laser sights, vertical & angled grips, supressors, extended barrels and bayonets. The commando variant can fit grips and laser sights.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The M16 can additionally fit a miniscope.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Many of the above mentioned guns will have a chance to spawn with some random attachments. The M46C CO rifle will always spawn with some random kit.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the bug where the M46C had a weird stock. Fixed some attachment locations on guns.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Gellied Napthal Type A has been added. It performs identically, just at higher damage. Available to specialists only.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The USCM Pyrotechnician Specialist kit now contains a flame tank strap pouch and a tank of Gellied Napalm A.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Every fuel type and flame thrower has had their stats adjusted. Generally, flames should be more dangerous to both sides.</li>

The only people who cannot be assigned to a marine squad are untrained civilians such as doctors. You must grab the person and click on the squad distribution computer to "scan" them in, and make sure they're standing next to the computer during the squad change/assignment.</li>

				<li class="tweak">You gain your original speed back much faster after being healed/getting surgery.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Made 'Go to Lobby' the default option when you do not get your job. Make sure your prefs are set to the correct option.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Made the M56D mount more resistant to explosions. Damage to melee will remain the same.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The clunkiness when setting up the M56D has been reduced. You still need to place the mount and setup the M56D as you normally would before. However, once the M56D has been fully built, you don't have to keep placing the mount and then the M56D. Instead, mount remains attached to the M56D and you only have to setup it up and screwdriver M56D to set it up again at a different position. Sprites by Frans.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscdel">Old armor logic was killed, thrown out of the window and buried.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New armor logic works as direct % damage reduction. If armor is too high compared to damage, further reduction is applied.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Damage for a lot of guns was changed. Health and armor for both sides was changed. Thus there is no point in giving changelog for them... but still see far below.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Armor hardiness is added to xenos. The longer xeno stays in combat, the less effective armor becomes up to the point of being completely useless. Your armor value is displayed to the right as a shield icon.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If xeno doesn't take damage to armor for 30 seconds and is on weeds, the armor regeneration will start. It will take 15 minutes for crusher to go from 0 to 100, and 5 minutes for low armored units like spitters, warriors, hivelords, burrowers.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Smaller xenos have evasion, which basically adds accuracy required to hit hostiles properly. Naturally, castes that don't have armor have this characteristic. Evasion goes better with upgrade for those castes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have more than 60% hardiness you regain armor faster. For example crusher will recover from 60% to 100% in 3 minutes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Warding pheromones no longer give armor and damage reduction. Warding increases needed critical damage to die, reduces damage to armor up to 50% on max level.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Burrowers are stronger in combat so they can be backstabbing semi-combat caste, but they are slow above ground.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Changed how many xeno-larva spawn from latejoin marines.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Queen heal and give plasma are made stronger to accomodate new HP values for Xeno.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Xeno progression is now fixed, so every caste progresses in a same way</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Runners, Drones, Sentinels, Boilers, Lurkers now have no armor and can't get any. They pretty much don't need armor integrity and are expected to get by with just pure health pool.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">CPR can now extend defibbable time for marines if you do it no often that once per 10 seconds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All weapon nerfs have been removed. M41 normal ammo received big damage increase. Slugs have less armor penetration but slugs break armor a lot faster. M39 normal ammo damage buffed. Flechette buffed, buckshot back to old damage values but armor can make it not as good as before. Buckshot should be good against unarmored.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Smartgun is super accurate (because it's smart), deals not very much damage but breaks armor fast.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Sentry turrets are very accurate but suck at armor piercing. Use it against quick enemies and use m56 against armored targets.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">SMG fire rate and damage buffed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Recovery is nullified while xeno is on fire.</li>
