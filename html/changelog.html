			<h3 class="author">TobiNerd updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed an issue with clicking signalers on top of each other. Fixed custom C4 not exploding correctly with signalers.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed chembomb fire radius modifier not multiplying by chem volume.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Nerfed OT rockets max power from 350 to 300 and OT mortars max power from 430 to 360. Both of these are still higher than the standard equivalent.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Overhauled the falloff values of explosive chemicals. This value is now more important to the radius of the explosion than before.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Default explosive chemicals can no longer be used with the synthesis simulator. The explosive property must be discovered through new chemicals.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reduced the max container size for OT rockets from 240 to 120.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Chemical explosives now calculate falloff levels based on additives to a base falloff, rather than doing an average.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Chemical explosives now have you trade between falloff and power, ANFO leaning towards the former and octogen leaning towards the latter. Cyclonite is in between.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Bomb casings now use a maximum total volume of containers rather than a maximum individual container volume. The volume cap has been decreased to make it harder to make all-in-one bombs, so you have to choose a balance.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The industry freezer will now max polymerize 3 containers at a time. Lowered how much paraformaldehyde is polymerized at a time in each container from 5 to 3.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The following chemicals now alter fire color much more dramatically. Carbon, Copper, hydrogen, lithium, methane, oxygen, phoron, phosphorus, potassium-chloride, salt.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Nerfed explosion wall bounce damage from a 0.9 to a 0.4 multiplier (Fourkhan).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the demolitions scanner not scanning the warhead inside assembled rockets and mortars.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the demolitions simulator no longer being able to create explosions after testing C4.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">C4 can no longer be placed on cades or crates, resulting in invisible C4.</li>
				<li class="tweak">C4 can no longer be placed humans that share faction.</li>
				<li class="tweak">If chem C4 or grenade explodes while being held by a mob or structure (walls are not structures), then it will now transfer full damage onto said mob or structure, and halve the actual explosion power.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Bombs with a signaler attached will now have a forced 3 second delay before detonating. A danger overlay will be visible for this duration.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now click a signaler with another signaler to copy over its code and frequency. #10824 Watermelon914.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Research chem names no longer end on a + or -. Apparently this was the reason some chems would glitch in nanoUI and become unpillable. Thanks to Alardun for helping discover the fix to this.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Reduced the cost of marine collectors to 5 metal.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased M4RA armour penetration a great deal.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed tray functionality. It is now just a cosmetic item.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Defenses rework to be handheld/instant-deployable versions. Squad Engineers can pick one from their vendor at the roundstart, deploying it by using it and disassembling it by using a multitool on it. Their functionalities are mostly the same, no generator needed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Bell Tower range increased to 5x5, whatever activates the sound will now be superslowed for 5 seconds.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Spawn Pool is now the new mechanic for burrowed larva. Burrowed larva spawn in periods from observers or when people join xenos from the lobby. Queen does not need to be in ovi anymore. Giving it bursted bodies will just increase stored larva by 1. Renamed to pooled larva.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Collectors and resource nodes have been removed for now. Building structures requires normal plasma.</li>

			<h3 class="author">Atebite updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Queens can now banish xenos from the hive. Banished xenos can be attacked by all other xenos, but cannot retaliate.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Queens can also readmit banished xenos back into the hive.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The hive gets a burrowed larva when a banished xenomorph dies. Abusing this is a great way to get banned quickly.</li>

			<h3 class="author">TobiNerd updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="wip">Until reactors get reworked: ship fusion engines now always start in perfect state with max fuel and no fuel consumption.</li>
				<li class="experiment">ORDNANCE TECHNICIAN UPDATE. The Maintenance Technician is now renamed to Ordnance Technicnan.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Ordnance Technician (OT) keep the duties of maintaining the OB cannon and may perform the same duties as the old MT, but their primary active job is the construction of new weapons for the USCM arsenal.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Moved Tank Crew quarters to the northern tank bay.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added an ordnance workshop in the area of the former tank bay. This workshop has everything needed to create custom explosives, although of finite quantity. Use your materials wisely!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the armylathe. The armylathe is a special autolathe in the weapons workshop that prints weapon parts. For now this is just for custom explosives. MT level engineering is required to operate the armylathe.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a demolitions simulator to the workshop. You can use this to test explosions.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the demolitions scanner. This is a special reagent scanner used for scanning bombs and analyzing potential explosive and fire hazards. Use in hand to print the latest reading.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now make custom mines, C4, mortar shells and spec rockets. Mortar shells and rockets need hydrogen or methane as fuel respectively.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Small chemnade casings can no longer be made by hand and large chemnade casings can no longer be made in the autolathe. Both of these must be made in the armylathe now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Small chemnades now fit in the underslug grenade launcher.</li>
				<li class="tweak">MT level engineering is now required to assemble any custom explosive, which can generally be refered to as chembombs.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Chemnades can now only use timers. Custom mines can use proximity sensors. Custom C4 can use any of the former plus remote signal.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Chemical explosions and chemical fire limits are now defined by the container. This means that the upper limit is significantly lower for grenades than what it used to be, while rockets and mortars are closer to the old upper limit. Overall all custom explosives have an upper limit of 150-175% that of the non customizable equivalent.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Chemical explosions and chemical fire reactions can now interact with each other.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Nerfed water and potassium explosive reaction as there has been added new explosives.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Added the following new chemicals.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Formaldehyde, made with 1 methane, 1 oxygen and 1 phoron. Formed in either a silver beaker (available in the workshop) or with silver as a catalyst. Used in making hexamine and paraformaldehyde.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Paraformaldehyde, made with 1 formaldehyde and 1 water inside the workshop industry freezer. Used in making octogen.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hexamine, made with 2 ammonia and 3 formaldehyde. Used in making cyclonite and octogen.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ammonium Nitrate, made with 1 ammonia and 1 polytrinic acid. Used in making ANFO.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ammonium Nitrate Fuel Oil (ANFO), made with 2 Ammonium nitrate and 1 fuel oil. This is a low strength and low cost explosive.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cyclonite (RDX), made with 1 hexamine and 1 polytrinic acid. This is a medium strength medium cost explosive.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Octogen (HMX), made with 1 hexamine, 1 polytrinic acid, 1 paraformaldehyde and 1 ammonium nitrate. This is a high strength high cost explosive.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Explosive chemicals can now be either sensitive or insensitive.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Sensitive explosives are potassium hydroxide (water and potassium), nitroglycerin and ANFO. These will spontanously explode if made in more than a certain quantity at a time or when ignited.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Insensitive explosives are ammonium nitrate, cyclonite and octogen. These will only explode when ignited.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the reactional chemical properties Oxidizing, Fueling, Flowing, Viscous and Explosive, which affect chemical fire and explosions.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the following purchaseable supply crates to Req.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Assembly crate, containing 5 of each igniters, prox sensors and timers.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Pyrotecnics crate, containing beakers of sulfuric acid, ethanol, phosphorus, lithium, salt and potassium chloride.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Phoron crate, containing 2 stacks of 30 phoron bars.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Plastic crate, containing 2 stacks of 10 plastic sheets.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Precious metal crate, a stack of each gold, silver and uranium.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Explosives production crate, two canisters with 400 units of each hydrogen, ammonia, oxygen, methane and polytrinic acid.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Added new sprites for chembombs.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Added dynamic reagent fillings for buckets.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Tool Storage Machine has been renamed to Component Storage Machine and a few has been removed from the Almayer. The YouTool vendor has been renamed to Tool Storage Machine. The Engi-Vend has been renamed to Electronics Vendor. The contents of these three vendors has been tweaked to be more specialized.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Vials from random vialboxes are now always full.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Proximity sensors now have IFF.</li>
				<li class="tweak">It is now possible to disarm C4 with a multitool, or dissolve it with acid.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed the public autolathe in the hangar.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased bucket metal costs.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now dispose reagents from the chem grinder.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added mopbuckets to the autolathe for twice the cost of a normal bucket. Holds twice the amount.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Research Cells are no longer excempt from the grenade antigrief. So OTs don't go to research to turn them into your test lab, you aren't supposed to spend the whole round testing. That is why you have the demo scanner.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Ordnance Technician will be restricted behind 3 hours of squad engineer playtime, when time restrictions are reactivated.</li>
				<li class="experiment">The code for almost all explosive devices were configured to be compatible with the above updates. If any explosive behaves oddly, please gitlab it.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Vampmare updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="experiment">Marine Defenses are here. This rework is intended to improve on planetside construction of defenses and give marines their own variant of XSS. The basic idea is that you build a Generator, then you gather crystals to keep it powered and the Generator will then power Defenses in the nearby area as long as its powered. Defenses are made by metal, making a base, making a module and inserting it into the base and welding.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Generator, it will power Defenses in a 7x7 area around it. It is powered by phoron gathered by Collectors.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Collector, this item is built from metal and when placed on phoron it will harvest it for any generators on the map.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Tesla Coil, it will zap nearby mobs without proper ID, dazing and slowing them. Defenses placed one tile near it will also be zapped and turned off.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Flamer Sentry, it's normal sentry but it shoots fireballs that leave behind blue flames.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Bell Tower, it will play a loud noise if an enemy moves within 1 tile of it. It will only play the sound once for the same enemy until reset by new enemy running through.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Planted Flag, it will boost nearby marines in a 5x5 radius with Hold order and Focus order.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Defense base, modules and the Generator can be crowbared to get the resources used back. The phoron is lost in the case of the Generator.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">There are now emergency phoron tanks to power Generators in the red alert chambers on Almayer, specifically in Engineering and in CIC.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reworked the Sentry to be in line with the other Defenses.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Wall deconstruction is changed to weld->screwdriver->wirecutter->wrench->crowbar.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Barricades changed. If you are further than 4 tiles away from the barricade, and you're shooting from direction behind it, you will no longer hit it. So placing barricades every 4th tile and shooting from the back one is now possible.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added metal barricade upgrades, there are three variants you can upgrade your metal barricade into, you do it by clicking them with a metal stack. Each upgrade costs 2 metal, Biohazardous will increase its resistance against acid/burn damage, but decrease a small amount against brute. Reinforced will increase against brute, but decrease a small amount against acid/burn. Explosive will increase against explosive.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Metal cades health have been buffed slightly.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Defenses and barricade upgrade sprites are done by Triiodine.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mini-engineer kit now contains a M56D fully kitted out for use. You can wear the M56D on your back. M56D assembling and disassembling is based on engineering skill.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The shared engineer vendor has been removed. Mortar is now only available from REQ. The metal and plasteel has been added to the standard engineer vendors. Mortar cost lowered in REQ.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Jurisdictional Automated System implemented. All arrests will have to go through this machine. An incident report is made on this machine with the criminals ID. Take their ID off, click on the button in JAS with the ID in hand, they get added. Print the incident when done and bring it to the Brig Cells. Insert the incident into the Brig System</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Brig System implemented. This handles the release of prisoners. Multiple reports can be inserted into and activated at the same time. The selected report will show up as a timer. When it is time for release, ARES will notify all MPs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Forensic Scanner, when things are broken or hacked on Almayer they sometimes leave behind a set of prints. Scan them with the Forensic Scanner and insert the scanner in the Security Records computer. Read Fingerprint to see who did the crime and clear the scanner to scan new prints.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Structural damage done to Almayer will now be announced for the whole ship. Destroying walls and windows. It is in our best interest to keep the ship whole.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased the accuracy of the Taser immensely.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Flashbang resistance and pepperspray resistance is now based on MP skill.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased maturity rate now stops after 30 minutes.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added cooldown to the ARES reports.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added shutters to the Brig Windows, the button is inside the shared cell.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Sentries will no longer shoot through smoke.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed the larva growth bonus of nested infected marines in sight of each other.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Scout cloak rework. It is now toggleable and lasts forever, but when cloaked you are unable to shoot guns. Decloaking will leave you unable to shoot for a short while. When cloaked you have 100% chance to evade friendly bullets. So friendlies are unable to shoot you.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reduced the M4RA burst-fire fire delay. Reduced the burst amount to 2. Increased the magazine count to 16.</li>
				<li class="tweak">M4RA minimum required distance is now 4 tiles instead of 6, this means there is only an accuracy penalty for targets within the first 4 tiles.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Holding the objectives/phoron nodes will now slowly grant DEFCON to marines and hidden points to xenos. When the hidden points reach a threshold, a XRT will be sent in. This is to hopefully help against stalemates. Points gain and so on are experimental.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added four specialist kits as a DEFCON 2 reward.</li>
				<li class="tweak">DEFCON points and ASRS now use money to fund instead of points.</li>
			</ul>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Medical - Operation Tables now notify doctors of the following conditions: patient is unconscious (surgery can be started), patient has low blood (hook up those IVs!), patient has a low nutrition level.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Medical - ChemMasters can now transfer pill bottles to nearby smartfridges.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Xenos who are not fire immune will no longer recover health when on fire.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Xenomorph Hive Structures have been added to the game. Special construction nodes can be built by builder castes, leaders, or the queen depending on the desired restriction set by the queen at any time. Most structures require special hive weeds to be built and require Plasmagas as a construction resource, which can be gathered and delivered to construction nodes by builder castes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Plasmagas to the game. Plasmagas is a resource found on key locations of the map and can be gathered by both factions to give them advantages on the field.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added hive collectors, built by the resin construction ability when targetting a resource node or a tile with a resource node present. Gathers 1 resource per 10 seconds and puts it into the hive resource pool.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Plasmagas nodes will span in three categories, Hive, LZ, and Primary nodes will spawn depending on events triggered during the round.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hive resource nodes will appear after the first hive core has been built, selecting whichever node is closest to the hive position.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">LZ resource nodes will appear next to whichever landing zone was picked by the marines at the start of the round, after the takeoff cooldown has passed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Primary resource nodes will appear in central and key positions in the map, and will start appearing after 25 minutes have passed. Once a primary node has been depleted, depending on the player population, a new primary node will appear closer to whichever faction has gathered the least resources.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the ability to see resource node locations via the hive and command tacmaps.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the hive core, a hive structure that acts as a centrepiece to all hives by growing hive weeds and stockpiling Plasmagas.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the hive pylon, a remote structure that also grows hive weeds in a smaller radius as well as acting as a remote location from the hive to build hive structures and access the hive Plasmagas stockpile.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hive pylons and cores will strengthen celings above them by 1 to 2 levels if the area they encompass is already rooved. This will stop air support from being effective around hive locations.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the spawn pool, a hive structure that can be fed bursted corpses in order to respawn a single xenomorph that was killed in action. Spawning can be disrupted by either killing the queen or destroying the pool.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the egg morpher, a hive structure that can be fed bursted corpses in order to generate a total of 6 facehuggers (per corpse) gradually without the need of an egg. Also fires at intruders in a larger radius than normal eggs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the evolution pod, a hive structure that offers a bonus of 0.2 evolution per tick to all xenomorphs on weeds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the recovery node, a hive structure that slowly recovers oen xenomorph at a time when resting adjacent to it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hives will now have a reduced rate of burrowed larvae after 25 minutes into the round. You will need to gain captures in order to efficiently grow your hive.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Default monkey spawns have been reduced from 25 to 5. Extra monkies from survivor spawns have been removed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Young xenomorphs have been made significantly weaker. Later maturations have remained the same stat-wise.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Xenomorph acid splashback no longer stacks and has a cooldown applied before the next splashback can occur.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Multibursting has been removed.</li>
