			<h3 class="author">Awan updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Food icons have been tweaked. They used to be black-nothing-yellow-red, in order of hungriness. It is now nothing-yellow-red-black. Yellow is now when you need to eat, before getting a slowdown at red.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed overeating. It didn't do anything, just allowed you to eat a bit extra and lose it instantly.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">TheDonkified updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Pyro now has a "Fire Shield" that makes them immune to getting burn damage and igniting from fire. Other sources, such as WP smoke, incen bullets, etc will still be able to ignite the pyro spec while the shield is active. The shield lasts 6 seconds with a 15 seconds cooldown.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The M240T comes with a buffed underbarrel extinguisher with 500 units of water and the strength to extinguish xvar flames.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Specialist abilities can be macro'd. For now, there are only the Specialist-Activation-One and Specialist-Activation-Two verbs. Specialist-Activation-One is for scout cloak and toggling broiler-T fuel type. Specialist-Activation-Two is for activating pyro fire shield. You can still macro the specific verbs for those tools, but these specialist ability macros are there so you do not need to keep adding them when a new macroable ability is added.</li>
				<li class="tweak">RNG mechanics related to fire damage and ignition of mobs should be removed. No more flamewalking (unless you're immune). Fire deals the same damage now (no more RNG damage or length of being set on fire). Resisting from fire puts out fires at a consistent amount. Values are subject to change.</li>
				<li class="tweak">M240T can be manually reloaded and unloaded as long as you are not wearing the Broiler-T back harness. Once you put on the Broiler-T and fire, it will automatically eject your current magazine. Behavior when wearing the Broiler-T (unable to manually load or unload fuel tanks) is maintained.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Mag harness M240T will automatically snap to your Broiler-T instead of your armor slot.</li>
				<li class="tweak">All fire extinguishers fit in the fuel tank strap pouches.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Xenos cannot be healed while on fire.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Moved spec-only verbs to their own unique tabs.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Extinguisher can fit in the fueltank backpack (not the one that the pyro spec gets, the one found in the pyro kit/req).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Pyro PFC kit comes with an underbarrel extinguisher.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Offsets for unbarrel attachments of flamers have been properly set.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Pyro and people wearing fire suits will no longer receive extra damage from simply standing on fire (other mobs/humans would not receive any damage, just get ignited).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Crusher charge can go over window frames again (pending refactor)</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Spitter acid spray can go through mobs again</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Crusher can now go over tables, racks, and the retractable railing to req via charge</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">TobiNerd updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">ACID Harness configuration can now be viewed by anyone using a multitool, but the configuration can only be changed by those with medic level medicine skill. Research skill is still required to craft the ACID itself.</li>
				<li class="tweak">ACID Harness bloodloss config now triggers at less than 60% blood instead of 40%.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the synthesis simulator renaming chemicals to Reagent.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Relating properties that alter other variables in the reagent no longer makes those variables go into negatives. It is now reset properly (#12766 Alardun).</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Did a bunch of small mapping tweaks around upper medbay.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Research lobby is now larger and has been merged with the test lab. There's now a chem station in the lobby. The old test lab is now called the Research Workshop.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Research now has one small containment cell and two medium containment cells. The last two can be merged into one large cell.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Did some changes to the CL office and quarters. Quarters now have a separate bedroom and there's now a closet connected to the office.</li>
				<li class="tweak">To compensate for the now large amount of chemical dispensers on the Almayer, chemical dispensers now use a shared energy pool depending on their network (ground, medbay, research, misc). The Turing is not affected by this.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The hypospray lock is now togglable by verb (Toggle Hypo Lock) rather than screwdriver.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the medilathe to the research workshop, which can print medical related items. Some medical items have been removed from the autolathe.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Added new science machinery sprites based off old sprites left behind by NicBoone, modernised and animated by TobiNerd.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Vampmare updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Synthetics and preds won't stutter by pain anymore.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Human pain thresholds increased. So you need more pain before falling into crit.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Runner speed increased. Health decreased so that one PB kills them.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Spitter Frenzy now makes you slightly more faster.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Streamlined building of airlocks, walls and reinforced walls. Examining airlock assembly or girders will walk you through the steps. Girder for walls and reinforced walls. Airlock assembly + airlock circuit to make airlock.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now build fences with metal rods. Wirecutting a fence twice will give you back the metal rods.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now build window frames with 10 metal.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Airlocks are now deconstructed by welding it, screwdriver to open panel and then using crowbar.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tweaked pain so that it now progresses gradually. If you take a big hit, it doesn't jump right to hardcrit, it has to slowly go through all the pain tiers. Eventually reaching up at hardcrit. This work both ways, so also when you take painkillers. Pain tiers tweaked as well.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Fixed a bunch of pain bugs related to chems and organ damage.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tweaked Yautja and Synthetic pain to be less punishing.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Fixed a bug where synth borg charger didn't repair pain.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reduced the Yautja normal and heavy armour bullet resistance. Halved the rate Thwei heals brute and burn at.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased flamers burn damage slightly, rounded to nearest 5.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reduced all resin plasma costs by 30. Walls, nest and so on. Order Construction plasma cost reduced to 400.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reduced rifle base melee value so it can't one hit resin nodes.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The grass on CORSAT is now weedable.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Vicacrov updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Attaching a bayonet to a weapon now makes it a sharp item. (Suggestion 12544)</li>

				<li class="tweak">Command headsets (CO, XO, synth) now start with all four squad channels turned on. (Suggestion 12890)</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now use autoinjectors on yourself by pressing Z, similar to eating food. (Suggestion 12789)</li>
				<li class="rscdel">SCPs were removed from the game.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Facehuggers will now climb back into the egg morpher if they are directly on top of it, instead of dying in bulk.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">(Advanced buildmode) Shift + right click will delete all objects on a turf</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Admins now have access to the matrix editor</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Xenomorphs can now put hostile xenomorphs into their spawnpool for larva. Queens give 3 larva, T3s give 2 and T2s give 1. T1s and larva will give no larva (Alardun #12747)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Larvae inside a host will now be coloured towards whichever hive it belongs to (Alardun #12747)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hosts of a different hive can be re-infected by your own hive. Stealing hosts during XvX is now a viable strategy (Alardun #12747)</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Quick Clot, Peridaxon, Spaceacillin and Universal Enzyme not having an overdose effect (Alardun, #12758). They all now cause brute damage on overdose.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Paining is now a negative chem property.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Vampmare updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Backend for Pain has been redone. This will hopefully make it more consistent and easily tweakable. This may cause issues, so report any weird interactions.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed the hardcoded softcrit, crit and hardcrit values. They now happen depending on pain instead of at specific damage levels. Inaprovaline still stops oxygen damage at crit and hardcrit.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Age/maturity is now a fluff indicator of how long a xeno has survived in a round.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Queen can now have 4 leaders and loses half of the pooled larva upon death. It used to scale with age.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Skill or ID-locked containers can no longer be emptied, opened, or otherwise their contents removed, if you lack either of these requirements.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Waltermeldron updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added a new gamemode called extended no spawn. In this gamemode, marines will not spawn at all and will not be able to latejoin. Might be useful for admins doing events that don't involve marines, such as XvX</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added hive-specific weeds, which will slow you down if you do not match their hive. Hive weeds slow down a xeno a lot more than regular weeds. Weeds will destroy other weeds if they don't match the correct hive, unless it is hive weeds. Xenos no longer regenerate plasma or health when on weeds that belong to a different hive</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added hive-specific walls, which take longer to destroy if you do not match their hive.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added hive-specific doors, which take longer to destroy if you do not match their hive. Larvae and xenos that do not match the hive cannot scuttle past or open the door</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added hive-specific nests, sticky resin and fast resin. Any xeno can unnest a nest that does not belong to their hive. Sticky resin will massively slow down any xeno that is not of the appropriate hive. Fast resin will only affect xenos of the appropriate hive.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Most xeno abilities will now work on hostile xenos. Stuns will not work on big xenos. There are some exceptions, however, such as Queen screech</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Burrower traps will now trigger against hostile hives</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Projectiles from xenos will hit hostile xenos now</li>
				<li class="tweak">Most objects and special structures will now properly resemble the colour and the name of their correct hive. This includes eggs and facehuggers</li>
				<li class="tweak">Resin traps can now be destroyed by xeno projectiles, provided that the resin trap does not belong to the xenomorph's hive</li>
				<li class="tweak">Eggs will show which hive they belong to upon examination</li>
				<li class="tweak">Eggs can only be planted on their appropriate hive weeds</li>

				<li class="tweak">Xenos now deal more damage to each other now. This also applies to XvX projectiles and abilities</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Weed nodes can no longer be planted on hive weeds.</li>

This also means Tcomms won't be tied to Almayer (important for WO) - if you have a relay tower on the surface you can communicate there, even if Almayer is down.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Deleted unused communication logic from the various Tcomm machines.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">WO now uses the new Tcomms relay tower.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Predalien sprites not working.</li>
				<li class="tweak">All basic suits can now fit some basic equipment into their HUD slot - a flashlight, crowbar, radio, health analyser, oxygen tank and a pen.

				<li class="tweak">Evilution time bonus is now incremented more granularly by about 0.1 every 3 minutes.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Xenos can grab all spawned corpses to use for their Egg Morphers. Useful for Forward Operating Hives.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Spawn Pools spawn hive-appropriate larva.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Re-added a short timer for taking over an SSD larva to avoid some race conditions and people getting kicked out of larva they just occupied.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added a new access class for civilians - civilian command.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">CORSAT access has been tweaked a bit - it won't require Corporate access, but use civilian command access.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Updated various survivor access to use some newly added access classes.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">CORSAT now has some Powerloader pamphlets around the Powerloader bays for those ungas that want to go Ripley on Queen's thorax.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Synth defibbing timer has been extended to give ghosts more time to get back into their body.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Defib healing amount has been made flat to that of a doctor skill.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Give Synth skill speed boost to some minor timers around stripping and putting items back onto people, tcomms assembly and repair, removing splints.</li>

				<li class="experiment">Reworked the chemical property system backend. All chemicals are now processed using properties, not just research chems. On the frontend chemicals should be basically unaffected by this, but some chemicals and some properties have still received minor tweaks as a result of the rework for the purpose of standardization.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the properties hemositic, thermostabilizing, focusing, cardiostabilizing, aiding, oxygenating, anticarcinogenic and ciphering.

			<h3 class="author">ThePiachu updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Overhauled internal logic of how power is handled.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a garbage collector to the game. It's basically a background process that will periodically delete junk items from the game to hopefully lower late game lag. The items removed shouldn't affect the gameplay - burnt out flares, empty boxes, spent casings, literal garbage, etc. It won't remove items from your inventory in case you want to hold onto something specifically, and it won't instantly delete newly created garbage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added boxes of MREs and flares, so that Requisitions won't have to send them down in backpacks. Sprites by Triiodine.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed Requisitions crates to use those boxes instead of the loose items.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed Large Supply Crates to do the same (you can find one in Requisitions!).</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed weapon-specific skills (pistols, shotguns, SMGs, etc.) - they were too redundant.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed the Survival skill - it was only used to gate one recipe - molotov cocktail. Now everyone can make those! Just use paper on a bottle of something flammable.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Squished a lot of skill levels down to just a handful. They most often fall under "untrained / basic training (mini-kits) / trained (combat engis, combat medics, OTs, doctors, etc.)". Cut down on snowflake levels for singular roles, like Researchers being worse at surgery, or CEs being better at powerloader.</li>
				<li class="tweak">POs' Powerloader skill has been buffed. The only people with a mid-range powerloader skill are planned to be PFCs after reading a special pamphlet (not in a kit form, but found on colonies around powerloaders).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Some timers have been rebalanced based on the skill changes (like surgery).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Dual-wielding SMGs now has a higher scatter than before (due to removing snowflake SMG skill check).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Shipside Synths will have a new role to play in this new skill system. They will be more efficient at tasks with timers than even the specialised roles. This will mean they can prop up an entire department by themselves, so it will be up to the Command to apply them to the right place. Survivor Synthetics are not as well trained - they are only as good as a single trained individual, but still have the variety of skills to apply themselves anywhere.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Company has recently launched a colony diversity initiative! Not only will the Weston-Yamada colonies not be staffed by clones, they will have actual names and distinct features!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed the corpse spawner system to use Select Equipment system for loading gear, generating names, appearances, etc. This means the generated colonists will appear more varied.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The new USCM protocols have established that walking is now prohibited. All personel must either run or stand still, no inbetween! This extends to every person and creature in the area of operation, civilian or extraterrestrial. (Removed walk intent, it wasn't used anyway, now you will always be running and now have to worry about fat fingering walking intent and dying because of it).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Made WO compile again.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Motion detectors should properly disable themselves when a mob dies, gets hugged, gets buckled into a nest, etc.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Retrieve corpses objectives should display how many points they earn you, not only their completion percentage.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed some unused infrared sight from xenos (we don't use it anyway, it's a whole other BYOND feature).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed some null error around holsters.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Dead people's headsets disable themselves automatically. This is for performance reasons. The radios don't disable themselves when you get hugged or nested, so you can preserve that gameplay. To re-enable the headset, just open its menu, it will turn itself on automatically. Hopefully this will improve late-game performance, not having to send messages to 100+ corpses...</li>

				<li class="tweak">When the nuclear bomb is turned off, its timer resets to full - Marines have to commit to detonating it and not hold the enemies hostage at 30 seconds pause.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a command lockout to the bomb. If engaged by the command staff (anyone with Bridge access), it makes it so only command staff can toggle safety and toggle the timer. This is to limit potential griefing with the bomb timer.</li>
