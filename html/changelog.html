		<li class='rscadd'>New dropship equipment: Medevac System. It's installed at the rear attach point instead of the crewserved MG. It is used in combination with medic's medevac stretcher to evacuate a wounded marine or a marine in a cryobag to the Dropship. The Medevac works as follows: a medic unfolds their medevac stretcher in a non-underground location on the planet, they buckle a marine or a bodybag/cryobag to the stretcher, they activate the stretcher's beacon via rightclick and wait. The dropship pilots now fly their dropship in 'flyby' flight, when in the air they use their console to select an activated stretcher, then they must go to the back of the dropship and click the Medevac System to activate its winch that will grab the stretcher, deliver its content to the dropship and drop the stretcher back to its original spot. The Medevac System has a cooldown of 1 minute between each use. Only Pilots can use the Medevac System, and only medically trained personnel can activate the stretcher's beacon.</li>
