				<li class="rscadd">Added L41A Battle Rifle.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Heavy Support kit.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Deployable Folding Barricades.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added IFTS Mini-Scope and Carbon Stock - Battle Rifle's unique attachments.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Rebalanced Marine Vendor costs. Item cost has been scaled to usefulness.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">MORE DETAILS:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">L41A Battle Rifle - easy to carry, doesn't slow you down, worse accuracy when wielded than M41A, better accuracy (slightly) when not wielded over M41A. This weapon can't burstfire but can become super precise with the help of attachments.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Battle Rifle uses its own magazines that use standard M41A ammo. Each magazine can contain up to 20 bullets, except extended mag that contains 35 bullets. There is also AP variant with standard capacity.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Battle Rifle can quickly (1 second) detach and attach its barrel attachment.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Battle Rifle can have following attachments: suppressor, bayonet, red dot, flashlight, extended barrel, quickfire adapter, magnetic harness, carbon stock, scope, miniscope, IFTS Mini-Scope.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">IFTS Mini-Scope - Unique attachment for the Battle Rifle. It allows you to zoom with offset akin to miniscope but has no drawbacks/benefits to accuracy or scatter. Scope also gives a small slowdown to movement speed while scoped in. Scoping in takes up to one second.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">IFTS Mini-Scope can be only received by taking mini-sniper kit or being Medic/Engineer and picking it as your free attachment.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">IFTS Mini-Scope has IFF but it also lowers your RoF.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Carbon Stock - unique attachment for the Battle Rifle. Gives Battle Rifle a significant increase in accuracy while only increasing wield delay and size.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Mini-sniper kit now provides L41A Battle Rifle, Supressor, Extended Barrel, IFTS Mini-Scope, Carbon Stock, 2 Battle Rifle AP mags.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Composite Deployable Folding Barricades - barricade that can be deployed in 3 seconds without any training. They can be repaired without skill for 40% of their health. If Folding Barricade took more than 40% of the damage, it's maximum possible health after repairs will lower.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">To collapse barricade, drag its deployed sprite onto yourself. Collapsing a barricade takes 10 seconds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Folding Barricades are resistant to acid (cannot be melted), cannot be jumped over (as if they had barbed wire) but do not slash back. They cannot be rotated or moved, they can be only undeployed and then redeployed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Folding Barricades can only be carried in hands or on the back instead of backpack.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Folding Barricades are extremely rare.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added 4xFolding Barricade to req for 100 points.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a rare requisition only kit - Heavy Support Kit. It conists of: HP Rifle, 1 ammo box for HP rifle, Bipod, Folding Barricade, Welding Tool and Welding Glasses.</li>

The Xenomorph Queen can diffuse the bomb by clicking on it, and this takes 15 seconds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Tank crewmen have been re-enabled as roundstart crew. The tank vendor has been replaced with a tank part fabricator, which starts at 0 points.

They are available from the marine vendors for 30 points, as well as given to Intelligence officers for free.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Fulton recovery system, a new dropship hardpoint that can be used during transit (without requiring flyby). In order to use it, install the system and select it using the cockpit while in transit. Balloons set up by ground-side troops will only last 3 minutes, so pick your targets carefully!</li>

				<li class="experiment">The first patch of the Xeno Rebalance is here. This is an experimental rebalance aimed at making younger tiers viable in combat, and making latter tiers less overwhelmingly strong. Nothing here is final and may change.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tier 1 Xenos have had their power curve lowered a little. Young Tier 1s are roughly equal to slightly better old Mature Tier 1s, with Ancients keeping their old strength - however, most of it has been trickled down to lower upgrades.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tier 2 Xenos have had their power curve lowered. Elder is now the peak strength, lower upgrades are about slightly better old Mature levels, and Ancient only gives you mutator points and an extra chevron.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tier 3 Xenos have also had their power curve flattened. Young Tier 3s are about midway from old Young to old Mature, while Matures retain full Mature T3 strength. Elder Tier 3s and Ancient Tier 3s now receive very slight bonuses to stats, and nothing major.</li>

				<li class="tweak">NEW: You can't peek thru signal flares with obstructed roof (so either clear sky or glass roof). You still can fire using those flares but you have to go in blind or work with ground team. You still can follow the fire mission's shooting path without obstruction but only after you start shooting.</li>
				<li class="tweak">NEW: Same for offset peeking. If tile is obstructed, your screen will go dark and you will receive a message. You still can execute Fire Missions.</li>
				<li class="tweak">NEW: Signal Flares has to be ON THE GROUND to work. Not in hand or in backpack. If you pick signal flare mid flight, Fire Mission will be aborted.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Above changes made to prevent queen killing in Ovipositor and some unfair air raids on spawn points. These changes do not completely remove it, they just make so that all parts of the marine forces has to cooperate to acheive game turning actions, and not just PO looking into every flare and jumping from offset to offset.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">PO's can now return their dropship home at any point from a Fly-By mission by hitting Abort. This sets the time left to land to 10 seconds.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">PO's and Queen can now see how much time left to fly.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Most of the round start PO equipment was removed (excluding ammo and few attachments). Points were refunded.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Added signal flares to SL and PFC vendors. Those act as flares that can emit light for less time than normal flare (around 5 times less). However they provide constant signal (until they are snuffed out or melted) to the PO and can be used instead of laser.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Signal Flare Packs can be bought from the Req.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Laser and Laser battery are made cheaper but they hit smaller AOE. Right now they are PERFECT weapon for Strafing Runs but be sure to spread shots, as different lasers hitting same spot is sub-optimal.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Installing a fuel enhancer will allow you to fly longer during Fly-By's.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Fire Mission Mode:</li>
				<li class="imageadd">PO's can set up Fire Missions - basically strafing runs on the surface of the planet.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Everyone in the radius of actual Strafing Run location are warned by loud sonic boom. Sonic boom has BIG radius, YOU ARE WARNED. But run and hide in any case.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Fire Missions should be created after all of the combat equipment has been installed on the dropship, including ammunition.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">In Fire Mission editor you can set up how mission itself plays out and with what offsets from the center (called GIMBAL). Do note, that all gimbals are relative to the direction of the strafing run, so if you do a strafing run south, left will be on the screen's right and vice versa</li>
				<li class="imageadd">While preparing for the Strafing Run you can peek thru the optical scope and see the situation planetside, change direction of the run and offset on that direction. You DO NOT NEED any additional attachments to do this.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">You can continue peeking thru the optical scope and see how your Fire Mission resolves in real time. That lets you trully feel the Xeno salt... or in case of FF Strafing Run... oh boy.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">If any error happens during Fire Mission setup, watch the chat for messages.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Every weapon has a delay in Fire Mission set up, so you can't fill every fire segment. Again, watch the chat for hints if you use incorrect cooldowns.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">GAU has a delay of 2. So you can do Fire-Wait-Fire.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Mini-rockets has a delay of 3. So you can do Fire-Wait-Wait-Fire.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Laser has a delay of 4. So you can do Fire-Wait-Wait-Wait-Fire.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Big rockets have no delay but they only have one rocket.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">FATTY AND NAPALM ROCKETS CANNOT BE FIRED DURING CAS RUNS.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Fire Mission has to have ZERO errors for it to be run-able. If Fire Mission stops abruptly, it's probably because it has error now (most likely no ammo). You have to have enough ammo for ALL of the strafing run. If you see numbers in yellow in the Fire Mission setup, that means you won't have enough ammo for SECOND strafing run. If numbers are red - you don't have enough ammo RIGHT NOW.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Better manual will be soon. So for now some rounds will have a PO Instructor Character explaining it ICly.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Interface sucks, but oh well, it's NanoUI.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">There could be some bugs with you being able to target caves, but note that even tho you CAN target them and WILL fire at them, nothing will happen and you will waste ammo.</li>

				<li class="tweak">No other changes were made to buckshot, so it still damages well even at 4-5 tiles, but chance of getting hit by all 4 pellets at that range is close to none even with attachments.</li>
