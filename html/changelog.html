			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscdel">Removed a ton of Syndicate items. We are not affiliated with NanoTrasen in any shape or form.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Armor has now random range from hit to hit. It's not big but this is added so no damage is the same from hit to hit</li>
				<li class="tweak">Marine Armor values are completely changed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Endurance is a useful skill now. Survivors have it super trained. Endurance helps you in avoiding IB and Organ Damage. It will help with bone breaks in future but not right now.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Some rarer armors protect you immensly from certain elements (like biohazzard against xeno spit) but are terrible at everything else. Experiment but remember that MPs can arrest you for bad uniform.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Light armor protects you against spit and gives you more speed "compensation" for gun weight</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Medium armor now has 3 pockets inside and has middle armor between Light and Heavy</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Heavy armor protects against explosions, melee and bullets. It also holds your intestines together so you get IB and Organ Damage less often</li>
				<li class="tweak">Masks defend your face against spit</li>
				<li class="tweak">Damage to armor only works after 0.2 of a second pass, so if you shoot flechette or something at xeno, armor only changes after all bullets connect</li>
				<li class="tweak">There is a mechanic with armor that if person is dealt damage much less than the armor, the armor has MORE effect on that attack. Now this mechanic also takes into account current armor integrity</li>
				<li class="rscadd">IB and Organ Damage uses new "armor-damage system". "Armor Integrity" for IB and Organ Damage is your leftover health on the limb, which means that the more limb is damaged the bigger chance you have to get IB or Organ Damage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">IO Suit now has 4 pockets</li>
				<li class="tweak">Acid Spit armor penetration reduced. Acid Spit elder+ damage reduced.</li>

				<li class="rscdel">Old armor logic was killed, thrown out of the window and buried.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New armor logic works as direct % damage reduction. If armor is too high compared to damage, further reduction is applied.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Damage for a lot of guns was changed. Health and armor for both sides was changed. Thus there is no point in giving changelog for them... but still see far below.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Armor hardiness is added to xenos. The longer xeno stays in combat, the less effective armor becomes up to the point of being completely useless. Your armor value is displayed to the right as a shield icon.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If xeno doesn't take damage to armor for 30 seconds and is on weeds, the armor regeneration will start. It will take 15 minutes for crusher to go from 0 to 100, and 5 minutes for low armored units like spitters, warriors, hivelords, burrowers.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Smaller xenos have evasion, which basically adds accuracy required to hit hostiles properly. Naturally, castes that don't have armor have this characteristic. Evasion goes better with upgrade for those castes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have more than 60% hardiness you regain armor faster. For example crusher will recover from 60% to 100% in 3 minutes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Warding pheromones no longer give armor and damage reduction. Warding increases needed critical damage to die, reduces damage to armor up to 50% on max level.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Burrowers are stronger in combat so they can be backstabbing semi-combat caste, but they are slow above ground.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Changed how many xeno-larva spawn from latejoin marines.</li>
