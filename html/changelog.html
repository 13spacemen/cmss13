			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Prison Station. The grass is diggable now. Added a grass patch to Yard.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Prison Station. Added a cautery to the surgery room (#4752) and a few more welding helmets around the map (#5601).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Prison Station. The ceiling was changed to glass everywhere, meaning that medevac/CAS/supply drops are available thorough the entire map.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Prison Station. Xeno spawnpoints were tweaked to allow more options for a starter hive (#1986). Survivor, monkey, and predator spawnpoints were changed accordingly.</li>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">ThePiachu updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Old Follow verb has been restored. New Follow functionality (for right-click follow) is now under Follow Them. Since there is no way of creating a right-click verb without also creating a corresponging verb in the sidebar, it's there too now.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">11 February 2019</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Neth Iafin updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Most of the tweaks are directed at signal flares that were found a bit too much when used but at the same time rarely used.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Signal Flares now take time (5 seconds) before they become fully active. After that they can't be picked up. You can still push them with explosives, but why.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Signal Flare lifetime is now cut in half.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can't use Signal Flare that was activated on a different level.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Dropship roofs are now metal, instead of nothing, making pilots unable to see the target in another dropship.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Prison Civ Quarters now has heavy metal roof. Pilots can't see there directly either.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed Signal Flares from PFCs and SLs. Added Pack of Signal Flares (5 flares in it) to SL vendor for 15 points.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added few packs of Signal Flares to 'ColMarTech automated armaments vendor'. Bother your local RO to get some.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed sprite of Signal Flare Pack, thanks to Triiodine. Now Sig-Flare Pack is called H-89S.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed 2 roundstart mini-rocket stacks that were added last week.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed bug that forced view to reset on ladders, cameras and CAS.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed lost gimbals on Dropships.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">RavingManiac updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Acid spray will now reduce or extinguish fires, depending on fire intensity.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Explosions will clear smoke clouds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reduced burst delay of some automatic pistols, as well as the M46C.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Refactored attacks on simple animals. Such attacks now have the save audio/visual effects as attacks on regular mobs.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Quintupled line-of-sight embryo incubation bonus. As before, light is not neccessary for it to work.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Scary thing made scarier.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Adjusted skillsets of human factions:<br>- The CLF have poor firearms training, but make up for it with resourcefulness, plus diverse skillsets from their civilian backgrounds.<br>- The Freelancers and the UPP have roughly the same training as the USCM, but with additional construction/engineering skills.<br>- Private Military Contractors have superior firearms training, as well as security and construction/engineering skills.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">ThePiachu updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Select Equipment works on non-humanoids (including observers). If used on a non-humanoid, it will turn them into a human first before applying a preset.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Cryo ERT marines should appear in the crew manifest.</li>
				<li class="tweak">DEFCON's Cryo ERTs no longer announce a distress beacon, but spawn the same otherwise.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Faction information is embedded into users' ID. Antag vendors on the admin level refer to that ID now. Future items might refer to that ID as well rather than using mind's faction. Setting up mobs for an event should be easier with this.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Triiodine updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Changed X Y attachment location on M240 Incinerator.</li>

			<h2 class="date">09 February 2019</h2>
			<h3 class="author">MattAtlas updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Instructional Pamphlets have been added to PFC vendors. These items, when used, increase your selected skill level by one. Marines that already trained cannot use these.</li>
				<li class="tweak">All ERTs should now spawn with a full first aid pouch, which means HvH is slightly more playable.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Broken armor icons on ice are actually fixed now.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Miraviel updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Admin-level. Added a CLF/UPP bunker for HvH events (#5585).</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Neth Iafin updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">NEW: You can't peek thru signal flares with obstructed roof (so either clear sky or glass roof). You still can fire using those flares but you have to go in blind or work with ground team. You still can follow the fire mission's shooting path without obstruction but only after you start shooting.</li>
				<li class="tweak">NEW: Same for offset peeking. If tile is obstructed, your screen will go dark and you will receive a message. You still can execute Fire Missions.</li>
				<li class="tweak">NEW: Signal Flares has to be ON THE GROUND to work. Not in hand or in backpack. If you pick signal flare mid flight, Fire Mission will be aborted.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Above changes made to prevent queen killing in Ovipositor and some unfair air raids on spawn points. These changes do not completely remove it, they just make so that all parts of the marine forces has to cooperate to acheive game turning actions, and not just PO looking into every flare and jumping from offset to offset.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">PO's can now return their dropship home at any point from a Fly-By mission by hitting Abort. This sets the time left to land to 10 seconds.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">PO's and Queen can now see how much time left to fly.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Most of the round start PO equipment was removed (excluding ammo and few attachments). Points were refunded.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Added signal flares to SL and PFC vendors. Those act as flares that can emit light for less time than normal flare (around 5 times less). However they provide constant signal (until they are snuffed out or melted) to the PO and can be used instead of laser.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Signal Flare Packs can be bought from the Req.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Laser and Laser battery are made cheaper but they hit smaller AOE. Right now they are PERFECT weapon for Strafing Runs but be sure to spread shots, as different lasers hitting same spot is sub-optimal.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Installing a fuel enhancer will allow you to fly longer during Fly-By's.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Fire Mission Mode:</li>
				<li class="imageadd">PO's can set up Fire Missions - basically strafing runs on the surface of the planet.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Everyone in the radius of actual Strafing Run location are warned by loud sonic boom. Sonic boom has BIG radius, YOU ARE WARNED. But run and hide in any case.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Fire Missions should be created after all of the combat equipment has been installed on the dropship, including ammunition.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">In Fire Mission editor you can set up how mission itself plays out and with what offsets from the center (called GIMBAL). Do note, that all gimbals are relative to the direction of the strafing run, so if you do a strafing run south, left will be on the screen's right and vice versa</li>
				<li class="imageadd">While preparing for the Strafing Run you can peek thru the optical scope and see the situation planetside, change direction of the run and offset on that direction. You DO NOT NEED any additional attachments to do this.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">You can continue peeking thru the optical scope and see how your Fire Mission resolves in real time. That lets you trully feel the Xeno salt... or in case of FF Strafing Run... oh boy.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">If any error happens during Fire Mission setup, watch the chat for messages.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Every weapon has a delay in Fire Mission set up, so you can't fill every fire segment. Again, watch the chat for hints if you use incorrect cooldowns.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">GAU has a delay of 2. So you can do Fire-Wait-Fire.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Mini-rockets has a delay of 3. So you can do Fire-Wait-Wait-Fire.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Laser has a delay of 4. So you can do Fire-Wait-Wait-Wait-Fire.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Big rockets have no delay but they only have one rocket.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">FATTY AND NAPALM ROCKETS CANNOT BE FIRED DURING CAS RUNS.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Fire Mission has to have ZERO errors for it to be run-able. If Fire Mission stops abruptly, it's probably because it has error now (most likely no ammo). You have to have enough ammo for ALL of the strafing run. If you see numbers in yellow in the Fire Mission setup, that means you won't have enough ammo for SECOND strafing run. If numbers are red - you don't have enough ammo RIGHT NOW.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Better manual will be soon. So for now some rounds will have a PO Instructor Character explaining it ICly.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Interface sucks, but oh well, it's NanoUI.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">There could be some bugs with you being able to target caves, but note that even tho you CAN target them and WILL fire at them, nothing will happen and you will waste ammo.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">ThePiachu updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">PFCs have been given Kits. A Kit is a box that costs 45 kit points and will have a variety of items fitting a particular playstyle. Kits will be more cost effective than buying individual items from their vendor.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Current PFC Kits include mini-constructor, mini-engineer, mini-medic, mini-pyro and mini-sniper. Those are not nearly as potent as proper Engineers, Medics or Specs, but fulfill a similar role with more common items.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New role has been added - Synth Survivor. You can roll it independently of a normal Survivor, but you do need to be Whitelisted in order to play this role. If chosen, you start as a Gen 1 Synth on the planet surface. Normal Synthetic Guidelines apply. If a Synth Survivor is spawned, xenos will be compensated with extra smallhost spawn to balance things out.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a Working Joe gear presets for Admins to spawn as needed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Implemented #5371 - Gen 1 Synths will now change eye colour based on their intent.</li>
				<li class="tweak">M41A armor piercing ammo crate now contains an entire box of AP ammo, but is a bit more expensive.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed the flare pack from ASRS random drops.</li>

			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">08 February 2019</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Cakey updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added the ability to select primary landing zones. Dropship consoles have been added to LZ2 on all maps and will now only allow the Xenomorph Queen to interact with them if designated as primary LZ. The primary LZ can be selected from the CO's communications console. Primary LZ is defaulted to LZ1 25 minutes into the round.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The maintenance doors at LZ2 on Ice can now be melted after being opened by marines.</li>
