			<h3 class="author">TheDonkified updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Reworked the squad distribution computer so that almost anyone can be assigned to a squad. The only people who cannot be assigned to a marine squad are untrained civilians such as doctors. You must grab the person and click on the squad distribution computer to "scan" them in, and make sure they're standing next to the computer during the squad change/assignment.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Self-examine is slightly more descriptive in very niche situations.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You gain your original speed back much faster after being healed/getting surgery.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Made 'Go to Lobby' the default option when you do not get your job. Make sure your prefs are set to the correct option.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Made the M56D mount more resistant to explosions. Damage to melee will remain the same.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The clunkiness when setting up the M56D has been reduced. You still need to place the mount and setup the M56D as you normally would before. However, once the M56D has been fully built, you don't have to keep placing the mount and then the M56D. Instead, mount remains attached to the M56D and you only have to setup it up and screwdriver M56D to set it up again at a different position. Sprites by Frans.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">M56D mount can be constructed. First you need 5 plasteel (this is excuse for resistance to explosions). Then 10 metal and weld. Placeholder sprites for now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Motion detector can fit in armor slot now.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Humanoid mobs can no longer hurt others when on HELP intent. This includes shooting and melee. If there are any situations that I missed, report on Gitlab.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">There is now a preference to disable NON-HELP intent actions on YOURSELF from going through. For example, if you keep PBing and you accidentally hit yourself during screenshake.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Medic and engi vendors allow you to pick a vest instead of being constrained to webbing. Other specialized roles will still only get default webbing.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Can repair broken vendors as squad engi+. Steps are screwdriver -> wirecutter -> 5 cable coil -> 1 metal -> screwdriver.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Engineers can deconstruct all deconstructable machines now. However, they can't rebuild them (MTs+ can do that though).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Supply console in req can be repaired.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Burrowers can rename tunnels.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Railgun has lower delay between shots (10 seconds instead of 15).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Railgun always hits barricades.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Railgun does more damage to barricades.</li>
			</ul>

				<li class="tweak">Adjusted the CIC lobby and MP desk for better visibility. #6369</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Specialists now have access to SL req.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Intelligence Officers now have vendors instead of lockers.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Intelligence Officers now can hack APCs and airlocks instead of being able to build barricades.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Quick Clot and Peridaxon pill dosages were lowered to 7 from 10, to avoid instant ODing when two people administer them simultaneously. (OD threshold is still 20.)</li>
				<li class="tweak">Epinephrine is now made of Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and yields twice as much as before.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Pilot Officers and Synthetics can now regain control over the dropship by using the console - provided they can hack it for 3 minutes without dying.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Folding barricades, just like any other type of barricades, cannot be deployed on the dropships anymore.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Intelligence officers now spawn with a pair of insulated gloves.</li>

			<h3 class="author">John Titor updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="wip">A number of balance changes have been made to prepare for new Xeno strains in the following weeks.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Refactored xeno health scaling. Xenos receive their largest growth in HP at Elder, while Ancient is now a very small increase.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Moderately increased xeno health across the board, with more favor toward flimsier castes. Ancient lurkers are no longer weaker than ancient drones.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Halved the time it takes for a ghost to occupy a buried larva. Xenos will obtain reinforcements from deadchat faster.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">MattAtlas, Vicacrov updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Squad leaders, attention! Squad-based requisitions have been added west of your squad preps. It will be your (and your acting variants') job to manage them.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">These requisitions outlets have all three vendors found in cargo, however they have less stock overall. These numbers are not final and will change!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Acting squad leaders have access to the squad requisitions rooms.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All squad roles now have an attachments box (the same as WO's) in their vendor.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Flare ammo is now IFF.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Neth updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscdel">Old armor logic was killed, thrown out of the window and buried.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New armor logic works as direct % damage reduction. If armor is too high compared to damage, further reduction is applied.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Damage for a lot of guns was changed. Health and armor for both sides was changed. Thus there is no point in giving changelog for them... but still see far below.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Armor hardiness is added to xenos. The longer xeno stays in combat, the less effective armor becomes up to the point of being completely useless. Your armor value is displayed to the right as a shield icon.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If xeno doesn't take damage to armor for 30 seconds and is on weeds, the armor regeneration will start. It will take 15 minutes for crusher to go from 0 to 100, and 5 minutes for low armored units like spitters, warriors, hivelords, burrowers.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Smaller xenos have evasion, which basically adds accuracy required to hit hostiles properly. Naturally, castes that don't have armor have this characteristic. Evasion goes better with upgrade for those castes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have more than 60% hardiness you regain armor faster. For example crusher will recover from 60% to 100% in 3 minutes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Warding pheromones no longer give armor and damage reduction. Warding increases needed critical damage to die, reduces damage to armor up to 50% on max level.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Burrowers are stronger in combat so they can be backstabbing semi-combat caste, but they are slow above ground.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Changed how many xeno-larva spawn from latejoin marines.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Queen heal and give plasma are made stronger to accomodate new HP values for Xeno.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Xeno progression is now fixed, so every caste progresses in a same way</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Runners, Drones, Sentinels, Boilers, Lurkers now have no armor and can't get any. They pretty much don't need armor integrity and are expected to get by with just pure health pool.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">CPR can now extend defibbable time for marines if you do it no often that once per 10 seconds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All weapon nerfs have been removed. M41 normal ammo received big damage increase. Slugs have less armor penetration but slugs break armor a lot faster. M39 normal ammo damage buffed. Flechette buffed, buckshot back to old damage values but armor can make it not as good as before. Buckshot should be good against unarmored.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Smartgun is super accurate (because it's smart), deals not very much damage but breaks armor fast.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Sentry turrets are very accurate but suck at armor piercing. Use it against quick enemies and use m56 against armored targets.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">SMG fire rate and damage buffed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Recovery is nullified while xeno is on fire.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Bipod increases rate of fire of sniper rifle by 150%</li>
