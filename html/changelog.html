				<li class="rscadd">Role timelocks are here. Once enabled, new players will be unable to play as roles they do not meet the playtime requirements to. You will be able to view any unmet requirements for a role in the character creation menu. Additionally, Queen will be timelocked as well (Only for round-start, anyone can still evolve to queen after the round has started). Existing players with playtime in a role will have their roles unlocked without needing to meet any requirements.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Senior Enlisted advisor, a mentor-only role dedicated to helping and teaching players about game mechanics, regulations, law, and potentially offering new roleplay opportunities for ship-side roles.

				<li class="rscadd">SEA players with over 9 hours played will be granted the rank of E9 SGM (Sergeant Major)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added minimum character ages to certain roles. If your character does not meet the age requirement for the role you are spawned in as, it will be changed to the minimum age.</li>
