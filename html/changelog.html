			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Shaman Carrier not giving shields to other xenos.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Completely reworked Boxer Warrior skillset.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Boxer Warrior passive - KO Counter. Every hit against same opponent builds up KO counter. Slashes and disarms give 0.5 counter, while Punch and Jab give 1 counter. Changing target or not attacking target for 5 seconds will reset the counter. This includes abilities and usual attacks.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Second Boxer Warrior passive - Clarity. Boxer warrior can shrug off limited number of adverse effects (like daze and knockdown) before those effects can actually do something to it. Boxer Warrior starts with 6 stacks of clarity and regenerates one point each minute. Uppercut regenerates Clarity based on how much KO points they have.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Jab - 4 seconds cooldown. Range 3 ability that Boxer can use to reduce distance. On hit it does not deal damage, but slows and dazes target for 2 seconds (assuming 0 Endurance). It also resets Punch cooldown.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Punch - 4 seconds cooldown. Range 2 ability. On hit it deals same amount of damage as usual warrior punch, but does not break bones. This ability also pushes target 1-2 tiles away from you, and resets Jab cooldown.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Uppercut - 10 seconds cooldown. If you are near your target you will automatically hit them. On contact it will put your Jab and Punch on cooldown, reset your KO counter and heal you for 5% of max hp times the KO counter. It will also do following effects if the KO counter is high enough (all of them is KO counter is bigger or equal to 9)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have at least 1 KO point during Uppercut it will deal 15 damage per KO point</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have at least 3 KO points during Uppercut it will knock back target. This knockback scales with KO points and will deal damage if target hits wall.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have at least 6 KO points during Uppercut it will knock down the target for 3 (or more) seconds (assuming no Endurance). This scales with KO points.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have at least 9 KO points during Uppercut, target will be slept for 10 seconds and will be completely out cold.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Boxer max Clarity nerfed 6 -> 3.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Boxer Clarity regen delay reduced from 60 seconds to 15 seconds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Uppercut no longer restores Clarity.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Stun from Uppercut halved.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Uppercut is now target ability. It won't work or go on CD if you click not on your punching target.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Xenos not being able to sleep if they have knockdown resistance</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Boxer getting frozen in place (stunned) by explosives while Knockdown was absorbed.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Added the following preset - Engineer. It is the only survivor having engineer (2) level construction (plasteel cade, windows, etc). Similar to the Miner, they can also operate Powerloaders.</li>

Timers were increased to avoid cheesy dropping-op-stuff on top of T3s. If these changes lead to tedious megaFOBs, Xenomorphs may be given more tools to destroy them.

Specialist-Activation-One is for scout cloak and toggling broiler-T fuel type. Specialist-Activation-Two is for activating pyro fire shield. You can still macro the specific verbs for those tools, but these specialist ability macros are there so you do not need to keep adding them when a new macroable ability is added.</li>
				<li class="tweak">RNG mechanics related to fire damage and ignition of mobs should be removed. No more flamewalking (unless you're immune). Fire deals the same damage now (no more RNG damage or length of being set on fire). Resisting from fire puts out fires at a consistent amount. Values are subject to change.</li>

				<li class="rscdel">Removed weapon-specific skills (pistols, shotguns, SMGs, etc.) - they were too redundant.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed the Survival skill - it was only used to gate one recipe - molotov cocktail. Now everyone can make those! Just use paper on a bottle of something flammable.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Squished a lot of skill levels down to just a handful. They most often fall under "untrained / basic training (mini-kits) / trained (combat engis, combat medics, OTs, doctors, etc.)". Cut down on snowflake levels for singular roles, like Researchers being worse at surgery, or CEs being better at powerloader.</li>
				<li class="tweak">POs' Powerloader skill has been buffed. The only people with a mid-range powerloader skill are planned to be PFCs after reading a special pamphlet (not in a kit form, but found on colonies around powerloaders).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Some timers have been rebalanced based on the skill changes (like surgery).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Dual-wielding SMGs now has a higher scatter than before (due to removing snowflake SMG skill check).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Shipside Synths will have a new role to play in this new skill system. They will be more efficient at tasks with timers than even the specialised roles. This will mean they can prop up an entire department by themselves, so it will be up to the Command to apply them to the right place. Survivor Synthetics are not as well trained - they are only as good as a single trained individual, but still have the variety of skills to apply themselves anywhere.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Company has recently launched a colony diversity initiative! Not only will the Weston-Yamada colonies not be staffed by clones, they will have actual names and distinct features!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed the corpse spawner system to use Select Equipment system for loading gear, generating names, appearances, etc. This means the generated colonists will appear more varied.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The new USCM protocols have established that walking is now prohibited. All personel must either run or stand still, no inbetween! This extends to every person and creature in the area of operation, civilian or extraterrestrial. (Removed walk intent, it wasn't used anyway, now you will always be running and now have to worry about fat fingering walking intent and dying because of it).</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed some null error around holsters.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Dead people's headsets disable themselves automatically. This is for performance reasons. The radios don't disable themselves when you get hugged or nested, so you can preserve that gameplay. To re-enable the headset, just open its menu, it will turn itself on automatically. Hopefully this will improve late-game performance, not having to send messages to 100+ corpses...</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Removed default round start buff to upgrade and evolution for xenos</li>
				<li class="tweak">Evolution and Upgrade speed is now tied to number of xenos (more xenos, less upgrade), marines (more marines, more upgrade) and time (more time, more upgrade). To top it off, it is all finally related to number of Larva. If you have no larva, this bonus is not applied. The more larva you have, the proportionally more upgrade speed you will have. These effects are active only when queen is in ovipositor or first few minutes of the round.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Example, 100 marines, 10 xenos and 30 larva. Boost is 6.5x for the first ten minutes then it goes to 13x if NO XENOS JOIN after 40 minutes. If xenos keep joining as larva numbers lower, it will taper down, it will be about 1x when there are no larva left.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Returned basic increase for first 30 minutes for upgrade level and evolution. Now it's a maximum of two systems, whatever is bigger will be applied.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Xenos can now see their Evilution Boost level</li>

This special vest is will progressively scan its wearer for specific health issues and injecting its medicine when the conditions are met. Additionally it will also report the overall health to the wearer. Inspiration from #8988 by Alardun.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The A.C.I.D. harness inject conditions can be configured by using a multitool/security access tuner on the vest.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Research will start with two A.C.I.D. harnesses. More can be assembled by using a wirecutter on a webbing vest containing one healthanalyzer, radio, cable coil, hypospray and a battery.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a new type of randomly spawned research note, research grants. Scanning these at the research data terminal will reward research credits.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the chemical properties excreting, hypometabolizing, hypermetabolizing, sedative. Inspiration from #8970 by Watermelon914.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added 10 rare chemical properties. One rare property will now spawn in clearance level 3 and 4 chemicals at a 30% and 100% rate respectively, to make them extra special. Inspiration from #8914 by Watermelon914.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Hyposprays now have an internal vial that it uses as a magazine. This can be ejected after unlocking the hypospray with a screwdriver. You can still fill the hypospray directly if it has a vial in it, which will technically just transfer to the vial instead.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now add autoinjectors to vial boxes. The research centrifuge can now be used to fill autoinjectors. Boxes of empty autoinjectors has been added to research.</li>

				<li class="wip">Until reactors get reworked: ship fusion engines now always start in perfect state with max fuel and no fuel consumption.</li>
				<li class="experiment">ORDNANCE TECHNICIAN UPDATE. The Maintenance Technician is now renamed to Ordnance Technicnan.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Ordnance Technician (OT) keep the duties of maintaining the OB cannon and may perform the same duties as the old MT, but their primary active job is the construction of new weapons for the USCM arsenal.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Moved Tank Crew quarters to the northern tank bay.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added an ordnance workshop in the area of the former tank bay. This workshop has everything needed to create custom explosives, although of finite quantity. Use your materials wisely!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the armylathe. The armylathe is a special autolathe in the weapons workshop that prints weapon parts. For now this is just for custom explosives. MT level engineering is required to operate the armylathe.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a demolitions simulator to the workshop. You can use this to test explosions.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the demolitions scanner. This is a special reagent scanner used for scanning bombs and analyzing potential explosive and fire hazards. Use in hand to print the latest reading.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now make custom mines, C4, mortar shells and spec rockets. Mortar shells and rockets need hydrogen or methane as fuel respectively.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Small chemnade casings can no longer be made by hand and large chemnade casings can no longer be made in the autolathe. Both of these must be made in the armylathe now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Small chemnades now fit in the underslug grenade launcher.</li>
				<li class="tweak">MT level engineering is now required to assemble any custom explosive, which can generally be refered to as chembombs.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Chemnades can now only use timers. Custom mines can use proximity sensors. Custom C4 can use any of the former plus remote signal.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Chemical explosions and chemical fire limits are now defined by the container. This means that the upper limit is significantly lower for grenades than what it used to be, while rockets and mortars are closer to the old upper limit. Overall all custom explosives have an upper limit of 150-175% that of the non customizable equivalent.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Chemical explosions and chemical fire reactions can now interact with each other.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Nerfed water and potassium explosive reaction as there has been added new explosives.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Added the following new chemicals.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Formaldehyde, made with 1 methane, 1 oxygen and 1 phoron. Formed in either a silver beaker (available in the workshop) or with silver as a catalyst. Used in making hexamine and paraformaldehyde.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Paraformaldehyde, made with 1 formaldehyde and 1 water inside the workshop industry freezer. Used in making octogen.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hexamine, made with 2 ammonia and 3 formaldehyde. Used in making cyclonite and octogen.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ammonium Nitrate, made with 1 ammonia and 1 polytrinic acid. Used in making ANFO.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ammonium Nitrate Fuel Oil (ANFO), made with 2 Ammonium nitrate and 1 fuel oil. This is a low strength and low cost explosive.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cyclonite (RDX), made with 1 hexamine and 1 polytrinic acid. This is a medium strength medium cost explosive.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Octogen (HMX), made with 1 hexamine, 1 polytrinic acid, 1 paraformaldehyde and 1 ammonium nitrate. This is a high strength high cost explosive.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Explosive chemicals can now be either sensitive or insensitive.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Sensitive explosives are potassium hydroxide (water and potassium), nitroglycerin and ANFO. These will spontanously explode if made in more than a certain quantity at a time or when ignited.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Insensitive explosives are ammonium nitrate, cyclonite and octogen. These will only explode when ignited.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the reactional chemical properties Oxidizing, Fueling, Flowing, Viscous and Explosive, which affect chemical fire and explosions.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the following purchaseable supply crates to Req.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Assembly crate, containing 5 of each igniters, prox sensors and timers.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Pyrotecnics crate, containing beakers of sulfuric acid, ethanol, phosphorus, lithium, salt and potassium chloride.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Phoron crate, containing 2 stacks of 30 phoron bars.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Plastic crate, containing 2 stacks of 10 plastic sheets.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Precious metal crate, a stack of each gold, silver and uranium.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Explosives production crate, two canisters with 400 units of each hydrogen, ammonia, oxygen, methane and polytrinic acid.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Added new sprites for chembombs.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Added dynamic reagent fillings for buckets.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Tool Storage Machine has been renamed to Component Storage Machine and a few has been removed from the Almayer. The YouTool vendor has been renamed to Tool Storage Machine. The Engi-Vend has been renamed to Electronics Vendor. The contents of these three vendors has been tweaked to be more specialized.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Vials from random vialboxes are now always full.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Proximity sensors now have IFF.</li>
				<li class="tweak">It is now possible to disarm C4 with a multitool, or dissolve it with acid.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed the public autolathe in the hangar.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased bucket metal costs.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now dispose reagents from the chem grinder.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added mopbuckets to the autolathe for twice the cost of a normal bucket. Holds twice the amount.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Research Cells are no longer excempt from the grenade antigrief. So OTs don't go to research to turn them into your test lab, you aren't supposed to spend the whole round testing. That is why you have the demo scanner.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Ordnance Technician will be restricted behind 3 hours of squad engineer playtime, when time restrictions are reactivated.</li>
				<li class="experiment">The code for almost all explosive devices were configured to be compatible with the above updates. If any explosive behaves oddly, please gitlab it.</li>

				<li class="experiment">Marine Defenses are here. This rework is intended to improve on planetside construction of defenses and give marines their own variant of XSS. The basic idea is that you build a Generator, then you gather crystals to keep it powered and the Generator will then power Defenses in the nearby area as long as its powered. Defenses are made by metal, making a base, making a module and inserting it into the base and welding.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Generator, it will power Defenses in a 7x7 area around it. It is powered by phoron gathered by Collectors.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Collector, this item is built from metal and when placed on phoron it will harvest it for any generators on the map.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Tesla Coil, it will zap nearby mobs without proper ID, dazing and slowing them. Defenses placed one tile near it will also be zapped and turned off.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Flamer Sentry, it's normal sentry but it shoots fireballs that leave behind blue flames.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Bell Tower, it will play a loud noise if an enemy moves within 1 tile of it. It will only play the sound once for the same enemy until reset by new enemy running through.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Planted Flag, it will boost nearby marines in a 5x5 radius with Hold order and Focus order.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Defense base, modules and the Generator can be crowbared to get the resources used back. The phoron is lost in the case of the Generator.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">There are now emergency phoron tanks to power Generators in the red alert chambers on Almayer, specifically in Engineering and in CIC.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reworked the Sentry to be in line with the other Defenses.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Wall deconstruction is changed to weld->screwdriver->wirecutter->wrench->crowbar.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Barricades changed. If you are further than 4 tiles away from the barricade, and you're shooting from direction behind it, you will no longer hit it. So placing barricades every 4th tile and shooting from the back one is now possible.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added metal barricade upgrades, there are three variants you can upgrade your metal barricade into, you do it by clicking them with a metal stack. Each upgrade costs 2 metal, Biohazardous will increase its resistance against acid/burn damage, but decrease a small amount against brute. Reinforced will increase against brute, but decrease a small amount against acid/burn. Explosive will increase against explosive.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Metal cades health have been buffed slightly.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Defenses and barricade upgrade sprites are done by Triiodine.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mini-engineer kit now contains a M56D fully kitted out for use. You can wear the M56D on your back. M56D assembling and disassembling is based on engineering skill.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The shared engineer vendor has been removed. Mortar is now only available from REQ. The metal and plasteel has been added to the standard engineer vendors. Mortar cost lowered in REQ.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Jurisdictional Automated System implemented. All arrests will have to go through this machine. An incident report is made on this machine with the criminals ID. Take their ID off, click on the button in JAS with the ID in hand, they get added. Print the incident when done and bring it to the Brig Cells. Insert the incident into the Brig System</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Brig System implemented. This handles the release of prisoners. Multiple reports can be inserted into and activated at the same time. The selected report will show up as a timer. When it is time for release, ARES will notify all MPs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Forensic Scanner, when things are broken or hacked on Almayer they sometimes leave behind a set of prints. Scan them with the Forensic Scanner and insert the scanner in the Security Records computer. Read Fingerprint to see who did the crime and clear the scanner to scan new prints.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Structural damage done to Almayer will now be announced for the whole ship. Destroying walls and windows. It is in our best interest to keep the ship whole.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased the accuracy of the Taser immensely.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Flashbang resistance and pepperspray resistance is now based on MP skill.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased maturity rate now stops after 30 minutes.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added cooldown to the ARES reports.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added shutters to the Brig Windows, the button is inside the shared cell.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Sentries will no longer shoot through smoke.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed the larva growth bonus of nested infected marines in sight of each other.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Scout cloak rework. It is now toggleable and lasts forever, but when cloaked you are unable to shoot guns. Decloaking will leave you unable to shoot for a short while. When cloaked you have 100% chance to evade friendly bullets. So friendlies are unable to shoot you.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reduced the M4RA burst-fire fire delay. Reduced the burst amount to 2. Increased the magazine count to 16.</li>
				<li class="tweak">M4RA minimum required distance is now 4 tiles instead of 6, this means there is only an accuracy penalty for targets within the first 4 tiles.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Holding the objectives/phoron nodes will now slowly grant DEFCON to marines and hidden points to xenos. When the hidden points reach a threshold, a XRT will be sent in. This is to hopefully help against stalemates. Points gain and so on are experimental.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added four specialist kits as a DEFCON 2 reward.</li>
				<li class="tweak">DEFCON points and ASRS now use money to fund instead of points.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Xenos who are not fire immune will no longer recover health when on fire.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Xenomorph Hive Structures have been added to the game. Special construction nodes can be built by builder castes, leaders, or the queen depending on the desired restriction set by the queen at any time. Most structures require special hive weeds to be built and require Plasmagas as a construction resource, which can be gathered and delivered to construction nodes by builder castes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Plasmagas to the game. Plasmagas is a resource found on key locations of the map and can be gathered by both factions to give them advantages on the field.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added hive collectors, built by the resin construction ability when targetting a resource node or a tile with a resource node present. Gathers 1 resource per 10 seconds and puts it into the hive resource pool.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Plasmagas nodes will span in three categories, Hive, LZ, and Primary nodes will spawn depending on events triggered during the round.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hive resource nodes will appear after the first hive core has been built, selecting whichever node is closest to the hive position.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">LZ resource nodes will appear next to whichever landing zone was picked by the marines at the start of the round, after the takeoff cooldown has passed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Primary resource nodes will appear in central and key positions in the map, and will start appearing after 25 minutes have passed. Once a primary node has been depleted, depending on the player population, a new primary node will appear closer to whichever faction has gathered the least resources.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the ability to see resource node locations via the hive and command tacmaps.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the hive core, a hive structure that acts as a centrepiece to all hives by growing hive weeds and stockpiling Plasmagas.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the hive pylon, a remote structure that also grows hive weeds in a smaller radius as well as acting as a remote location from the hive to build hive structures and access the hive Plasmagas stockpile.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hive pylons and cores will strengthen celings above them by 1 to 2 levels if the area they encompass is already rooved. This will stop air support from being effective around hive locations.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the spawn pool, a hive structure that can be fed bursted corpses in order to respawn a single xenomorph that was killed in action. Spawning can be disrupted by either killing the queen or destroying the pool.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the egg morpher, a hive structure that can be fed bursted corpses in order to generate a total of 6 facehuggers (per corpse) gradually without the need of an egg. Also fires at intruders in a larger radius than normal eggs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the evolution pod, a hive structure that offers a bonus of 0.2 evolution per tick to all xenomorphs on weeds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the recovery node, a hive structure that slowly recovers oen xenomorph at a time when resting adjacent to it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hives will now have a reduced rate of burrowed larvae after 25 minutes into the round. You will need to gain captures in order to efficiently grow your hive.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Default monkey spawns have been reduced from 25 to 5. Extra monkies from survivor spawns have been removed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Young xenomorphs have been made significantly weaker. Later maturations have remained the same stat-wise.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Xenomorph acid splashback no longer stacks and has a cooldown applied before the next splashback can occur.</li>

				<li class="experiment">Vehicles have received a major overhaul, and now play very different to what you're used to. Make sure you read the changelog in its entirety to familiarize yourself with how vehicles have changed</li>
				<li class="experiment">Vehicle interiors have been added:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Multitile vehicles now have mapped interiors. Interaction with the vehicle is done by interacting with various objects inside the vehicle</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Interiors typically feature a driver and a gunner seat. To drive the vehicle, buckle into the driver's seat. To... gun, buckle into the gunner's seat. To stop driving/gunning, unbuckle from the seat (i.e. by resisting)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Passengers may enjoy the view by clicking on the viewports inside vehicles</li>
				<li class="tweak">Instead of ejecting people when the vehicle is destroyed, xenos can now enter the vehicle just like humans while they're on help intent, and may do so at any time, even when the vehicle is in working order. Vehicles can be entered and exited by both humans and xenos even when broken</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Vehicles spawn in with locked doors. When you're driving the vehicle, you get a verb that lets you toggle the door locks. You can enter vehicles even when they're locked if you have bridge, brig or crewman access</li>
				<li class="experiment">Vehicles now have momentum:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Vehicles have momentum. This means they'll start slow and pick up speed. Turning the vehicle makes you lose some momentum. You cannot immediately go in the reverse direction if you have momentum, but attempting to move in reverse will "brake" the vehicle and allow you to begin reversing faster</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you crash while the vehicle has momentum, unbuckled mobs and unanchored items will be sent flying</li>
				<li class="experiment">Hardpoints now function differently:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Reloading hardpoints is now done by using the weapons loader inside the vehicle. To load ammo into a gun, click on the weapons loader while holding the ammo. To reload the gun, click on the weapons loader with an empty hand</li>
				<li class="tweak">Vehicle hardpoints are now restricted by a firing arc. The firing arc varies from weapon to weapon</li>
				<li class="experiment">Vehicle repair and maintenance is now different:</li>
				<li class="tweak">Hardpoint slot repairs have been replaced with frame repairs</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When all hardpoints are broken, the vehicle frame will begin taking damage. Hardpoints cannot be installed on a broken vehicle frame</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Xenos can force their way into framebroken vehicles from anywhere, not only the vehicle entrances</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Crushers can move framebroken vehicles by charging into them</li>
				<li class="experiment">The tank has been reworked:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The tank now has a mapped interior. You can enter the tank the same way as before. The tank can fit 2 marines</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The tank's turret can now rotate independently of the rest of the tank. To operate the turret, buckle into the gunner's seat inside the tank</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The tank's turret features a gyroscopic lock, which will prevent it from rotating along with the vehicle</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The tank's turret is now a hardpoint. You can install it onto and remove it from the tank by using a powerloader</li>
				<li class="tweak">Primary and secondary hardpoints are now installed on the tank's turret, meaning the tank must have a turret installed in order to install primary/secondary hardpoints</li>
				<li class="tweak">Projectiles shot from the tank's primary weapon now begin traveling 1 tile out from the tank</li>
				<li class="experiment">APCs have been added:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The APC has been added. It's faster than the tank and can fit more marines inside, but has worse firepower. The stock APC can fit 10 marines, including the driver/gunner</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a medical APC. It has a surgery table and sleeper inside, and can fit 5 marines, including the driver/gunner</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a command APC. It has an overwatch console inside, and can fit 5 marines inside, including the driver/gunner</li>
				<li class="experiment">The tank bay has been changed:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Instead of there being a broken tank in the vehicle bay, there's now a ASRS elevator which you can order one vehicle from. You can order equipment from the vendor after ordering a vehicle</li>
				<li class="maptweak">The tank bay has been replaced with a ASRS elevator for vehicles</li>
				<li class="experiment">Other miscellaneous changes:</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tank Crewman has been renamed to Vehicle Crewman</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added a powerloader to the vehicle bay</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed some odd behavior related to rollerbed movement</li>
				<li class="tweak">Flare guns will now always hit the clicked target provided that there's a clear line of sight</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Reduced latency overhead on Sorokyne Strata. Keep an eye on your ping, it should be about the same as other maps now.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Made sure survivors don't spawn next to Larva on Sorokyne Strata.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Added the Clown back to Sorokyne Strata.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Larva that spawn in the Deep Jungle Security Outpost should no longer be trapped until they mature.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Tank (And eventually APC) are now enabled on Sorokyne, seeing as it is now Tank friendly. You need 100 readied players round start for it to spawn.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Greatly decongested Sorokyne Strata.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Removed nearly every platform in the way of primary combat lanes.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Increased all platform stair widths to minimum 3, with majority now being 5 wide.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added new lanes connecting Sorokyne Medical to Sorokyne Administration.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Increased the width of the lane connecting Sorokyne Medical to the Aerodrome.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Removed needless holes and platforms in the Aerodrome.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Opened up Sorokyne Engineering and added enough generators to power the whole map. Backup generators still exist and can be powered.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added some indestructable landmarks to the Sorokyne Deep Jungle, you should be getting lost a bit less.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Opened up the Personal Storage and Shower block on Sorokyne, it now connects to the North Wooden Hospital and Minehead, along with a new entrance to the Deep Jungle.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Opened up the areas around Sorokyne Administration so it's easier to navigate, or just cut past entirely.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added connecting lanes from Sorokyne Security Hall to the Northern Pass and Administration.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Opened up the lanes leading into South LZ1. More changes to LZ1 and LZ2 pending.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Reduced the viability of moving through LZ2 Telecomms Maintenance, going through the snow and ice is a much faster route.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Removed a lot of in-the-way walls in the Jungle that over complicated pathing. Sightlines should be clearer, and defenses for Xenos more easily constructed.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Spread out all the Xeno spawns on Sorokyne, hopefully this will encourage new hive locations. Previously all Xenos spawned in a ring in the south of the map.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Opened up ice platforms and the base lanes in the Cryo-Thermal marshes, there should be more platform options, but they're not required to navigate the area anymore.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Opened up the Deep Jungle Security Outpost so it's more hive-viable. Added some secondary flanks to its chokepoints.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added a new lane that leads into the North Passage and the Northern Basket Ball Court on Sorokyne.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added extra data-terminals and and reduced the total amount of objective items to Sorokyne, this should make DEFCON easier.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Removed all the doors cutting the Aerodrome off from the rest of the map.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added a new lane into the Canteen in the South, it leads directly to the upper decks. The previous lane was expanded, the kitchen is smaller as a result.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Widened the Administration back hall.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added a new lane between south Administration to the South Canteen hall, this connects it directly to the Aerodrome.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Removed needless platforms and railings in Sorokyne Engineering lounge and foyer, it should be much easier to navigate.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Reduced Sorokyne from 256x256 to 256x190 tiles.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Snowstorms now have to wait 20 minutes between potentially happening instead of 4.</li>
