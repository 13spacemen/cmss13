			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">All new item sprites are made by Triiodine.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added L41A Battle Rifle.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Heavy Support kit.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Deployable Folding Barricades.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added IFTS Mini-Scope and Carbon Stock - Battle Rifle's unique attachments.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Rebalanced Marine Vendor costs. Item cost has been scaled to usefulness.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">MORE DETAILS:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">L41A Battle Rifle - easy to carry, doesn't slow you down, worse accuracy when wielded than M41A, better accuracy (slightly) when not wielded over M41A. This weapon can't burstfire but can become super precise with the help of attachments.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Battle Rifle uses its own magazines that use standard M41A ammo. Each magazine can contain up to 20 bullets, except extended mag that contains 35 bullets. There is also AP variant with standard capacity.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Battle Rifle can quickly (1 second) detach and attach its barrel attachment.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Battle Rifle can have following attachments: suppressor, bayonet, red dot, flashlight, extended barrel, quickfire adapter, magnetic harness, carbon stock, scope, miniscope, IFTS Mini-Scope.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">IFTS Mini-Scope - Unique attachment for the Battle Rifle. It allows you to zoom with offset akin to miniscope but has no drawbacks/benefits to accuracy or scatter. Scope also gives a small slowdown to movement speed while scoped in. Scoping in takes up to one second.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">IFTS Mini-Scope can be only received by taking mini-sniper kit or being Medic/Engineer and picking it as your free attachment.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">IFTS Mini-Scope has IFF but it also lowers your RoF.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Carbon Stock - unique attachment for the Battle Rifle. Gives Battle Rifle a significant increase in accuracy while only increasing wield delay and size.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Mini-sniper kit now provides L41A Battle Rifle, Supressor, Extended Barrel, IFTS Mini-Scope, Carbon Stock, 2 Battle Rifle AP mags.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Composite Deployable Folding Barricades - barricade that can be deployed in 3 seconds without any training. They can be repaired without skill for 40% of their health. If Folding Barricade took more than 40% of the damage, it's maximum possible health after repairs will lower.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">To collapse barricade, drag its deployed sprite onto yourself. Collapsing a barricade takes 10 seconds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Folding Barricades are resistant to acid (cannot be melted), cannot be jumped over (as if they had barbed wire) but do not slash back. They cannot be rotated or moved, they can be only undeployed and then redeployed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Folding Barricades can only be carried in hands or on the back instead of backpack.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Folding Barricades are extremely rare.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added 4xFolding Barricade to req for 100 points.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a rare requisition only kit - Heavy Support Kit. It conists of: HP Rifle, 1 ammo box for HP rifle, Bipod, Folding Barricade, Welding Tool and Welding Glasses.</li>

They are available from the marine vendors for 30 points, as well as given to Intelligence officers for free.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Fulton recovery system, a new dropship hardpoint that can be used during transit (without requiring flyby). In order to use it, install the system and select it using the cockpit while in transit. Balloons set up by ground-side troops will only last 3 minutes, so pick your targets carefully!</li>
