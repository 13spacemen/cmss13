				<li class="tweak">Removed default round start buff to upgrade and evolution for xenos</li>
				<li class="tweak">Evolution and Upgrade speed is now tied to number of xenos (more xenos, less upgrade), marines (more marines, more upgrade) and time (more time, more upgrade). To top it off, it is all finally related to number of Larva. If you have no larva, this bonus is not applied. The more larva you have, the proportionally more upgrade speed you will have. These effects are active only when queen is in ovipositor or first few minutes of the round.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Example, 100 marines, 10 xenos and 30 larva. Boost is 6.5x for the first ten minutes then it goes to 13x if NO XENOS JOIN after 40 minutes. If xenos keep joining as larva numbers lower, it will taper down, it will be about 1x when there are no larva left.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Returned basic increase for first 30 minutes for upgrade level and evolution. Now it's a maximum of two systems, whatever is bigger will be applied.</li>

This special vest is will progressively scan its wearer for specific health issues and injecting its medicine when the conditions are met. Additionally it will also report the overall health to the wearer. Inspiration from #8988 by Alardun.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The A.C.I.D. harness inject conditions can be configured by using a multitool/security access tuner on the vest.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Chemical explosions and chemical fire reactions can now interact with each other.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Nerfed water and potassium explosive reaction as there has been added new explosives.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Added the following new chemicals.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Formaldehyde, made with 1 methane, 1 oxygen and 1 phoron. Formed in either a silver beaker (available in the workshop) or with silver as a catalyst. Used in making hexamine and paraformaldehyde.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Paraformaldehyde, made with 1 formaldehyde and 1 water inside the workshop industry freezer. Used in making octogen.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hexamine, made with 2 ammonia and 3 formaldehyde. Used in making cyclonite and octogen.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ammonium Nitrate, made with 1 ammonia and 1 polytrinic acid. Used in making ANFO.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ammonium Nitrate Fuel Oil (ANFO), made with 2 Ammonium nitrate and 1 fuel oil. This is a low strength and low cost explosive.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Octogen (HMX), made with 1 hexamine, 1 polytrinic acid, 1 paraformaldehyde and 1 ammonium nitrate. This is a high strength high cost explosive.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Explosive chemicals can now be either sensitive or insensitive.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Sensitive explosives are potassium hydroxide (water and potassium), nitroglycerin and ANFO. These will spontanously explode if made in more than a certain quantity at a time or when ignited.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Insensitive explosives are ammonium nitrate, cyclonite and octogen. These will only explode when ignited.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the reactional chemical properties Oxidizing, Fueling, Flowing, Viscous and Explosive, which affect chemical fire and explosions.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the following purchaseable supply crates to Req.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Assembly crate, containing 5 of each igniters, prox sensors and timers.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Pyrotecnics crate, containing beakers of sulfuric acid, ethanol, phosphorus, lithium, salt and potassium chloride.</li>

				<li class="tweak">You can now dispose reagents from the chem grinder.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added mopbuckets to the autolathe for twice the cost of a normal bucket. Holds twice the amount.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Research Cells are no longer excempt from the grenade antigrief. So OTs don't go to research to turn them into your test lab, you aren't supposed to spend the whole round testing. That is why you have the demo scanner.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Ordnance Technician will be restricted behind 3 hours of squad engineer playtime, when time restrictions are reactivated.</li>
				<li class="experiment">The code for almost all explosive devices were configured to be compatible with the above updates. If any explosive behaves oddly, please gitlab it.</li>

				<li class="experiment">Marine Defenses are here. This rework is intended to improve on planetside construction of defenses and give marines their own variant of XSS. The basic idea is that you build a Generator, then you gather crystals to keep it powered and the Generator will then power Defenses in the nearby area as long as its powered. Defenses are made by metal, making a base, making a module and inserting it into the base and welding.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Generator, it will power Defenses in a 7x7 area around it. It is powered by phoron gathered by Collectors.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Collector, this item is built from metal and when placed on phoron it will harvest it for any generators on the map.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Tesla Coil, it will zap nearby mobs without proper ID, dazing and slowing them. Defenses placed one tile near it will also be zapped and turned off.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Flamer Sentry, it's normal sentry but it shoots fireballs that leave behind blue flames.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Bell Tower, it will play a loud noise if an enemy moves within 1 tile of it. It will only play the sound once for the same enemy until reset by new enemy running through.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Planted Flag, it will boost nearby marines in a 5x5 radius with Hold order and Focus order.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Defense base, modules and the Generator can be crowbared to get the resources used back. The phoron is lost in the case of the Generator.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">There are now emergency phoron tanks to power Generators in the red alert chambers on Almayer, specifically in Engineering and in CIC.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reworked the Sentry to be in line with the other Defenses.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Wall deconstruction is changed to weld->screwdriver->wirecutter->wrench->crowbar.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Barricades changed. If you are further than 4 tiles away from the barricade, and you're shooting from direction behind it, you will no longer hit it. So placing barricades every 4th tile and shooting from the back one is now possible.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added metal barricade upgrades, there are three variants you can upgrade your metal barricade into, you do it by clicking them with a metal stack. Each upgrade costs 2 metal, Biohazardous will increase its resistance against acid/burn damage, but decrease a small amount against brute. Reinforced will increase against brute, but decrease a small amount against acid/burn. Explosive will increase against explosive.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Metal cades health have been buffed slightly.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Defenses and barricade upgrade sprites are done by Triiodine.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mini-engineer kit now contains a M56D fully kitted out for use. You can wear the M56D on your back. M56D assembling and disassembling is based on engineering skill.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The shared engineer vendor has been removed. Mortar is now only available from REQ. The metal and plasteel has been added to the standard engineer vendors. Mortar cost lowered in REQ.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Jurisdictional Automated System implemented. All arrests will have to go through this machine. An incident report is made on this machine with the criminals ID. Take their ID off, click on the button in JAS with the ID in hand, they get added. Print the incident when done and bring it to the Brig Cells. Insert the incident into the Brig System</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Brig System implemented. This handles the release of prisoners. Multiple reports can be inserted into and activated at the same time. The selected report will show up as a timer. When it is time for release, ARES will notify all MPs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Forensic Scanner, when things are broken or hacked on Almayer they sometimes leave behind a set of prints. Scan them with the Forensic Scanner and insert the scanner in the Security Records computer. Read Fingerprint to see who did the crime and clear the scanner to scan new prints.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Structural damage done to Almayer will now be announced for the whole ship. Destroying walls and windows. It is in our best interest to keep the ship whole.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased the accuracy of the Taser immensely.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Flashbang resistance and pepperspray resistance is now based on MP skill.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased maturity rate now stops after 30 minutes.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added cooldown to the ARES reports.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added shutters to the Brig Windows, the button is inside the shared cell.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Sentries will no longer shoot through smoke.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed the larva growth bonus of nested infected marines in sight of each other.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Scout cloak rework. It is now toggleable and lasts forever, but when cloaked you are unable to shoot guns. Decloaking will leave you unable to shoot for a short while. When cloaked you have 100% chance to evade friendly bullets. So friendlies are unable to shoot you.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reduced the M4RA burst-fire fire delay. Reduced the burst amount to 2. Increased the magazine count to 16.</li>
				<li class="tweak">M4RA minimum required distance is now 4 tiles instead of 6, this means there is only an accuracy penalty for targets within the first 4 tiles.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Holding the objectives/phoron nodes will now slowly grant DEFCON to marines and hidden points to xenos. When the hidden points reach a threshold, a XRT will be sent in. This is to hopefully help against stalemates. Points gain and so on are experimental.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added four specialist kits as a DEFCON 2 reward.</li>
				<li class="tweak">DEFCON points and ASRS now use money to fund instead of points.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Vicacrov updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Medical - Operation Tables now notify doctors of the following conditions: patient is unconscious (surgery can be started), patient has low blood (hook up those IVs!), patient has a low nutrition level.</li>
