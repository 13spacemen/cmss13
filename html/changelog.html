				<li class="tweak">Objectives now have a guaranteed minimal amount of clues generated. Folders and Disks have two, safes have four, experimental items have eight.

				<li class="rscadd">Lurker Active #2: Invisibility. Makes you invisible for a maximum of 30 seconds. While invisible, your speed is increased and is further increased by the distance between you and your nearest ally (maximized at 40 tiles).</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Removed default round start buff to upgrade and evolution for xenos</li>
				<li class="tweak">Evolution and Upgrade speed is now tied to number of xenos (more xenos, less upgrade), marines (more marines, more upgrade) and time (more time, more upgrade). To top it off, it is all finally related to number of Larva. If you have no larva, this bonus is not applied. The more larva you have, the proportionally more upgrade speed you will have. These effects are active only when queen is in ovipositor or first few minutes of the round.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Example, 100 marines, 10 xenos and 30 larva. Boost is 6.5x for the first ten minutes then it goes to 13x if NO XENOS JOIN after 40 minutes. If xenos keep joining as larva numbers lower, it will taper down, it will be about 1x when there are no larva left.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Returned basic increase for first 30 minutes for upgrade level and evolution. Now it's a maximum of two systems, whatever is bigger will be applied.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Xenos can now see their Evilution Boost level</li>
				<li class="tweak">Humans that are running AND without suit armor (that is actually an armor and not a santa suit) can now be neuroed in one hit. This applies to all neuro shots.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Added a delivery chute in the OT workshop and research lobby that transports items to the requisitions.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Automated Chemical Integrated Delivery harness (A.C.I.D.). This special vest is will progressively scan its wearer for specific health issues and injecting its medicine when the conditions are met. Additionally it will also report the overall health to the wearer. Inspiration from #8988 by Alardun.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The A.C.I.D. harness inject conditions can be configured by using a multitool/security access tuner on the vest.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Research will start with two A.C.I.D. harnesses. More can be assembled by using a wirecutter on a webbing vest containing one healthanalyzer, radio, cable coil, hypospray and a battery.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a new type of randomly spawned research note, research grants. Scanning these at the research data terminal will reward research credits.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the chemical properties excreting, hypometabolizing, hypermetabolizing, sedative. Inspiration from #8970 by Watermelon914.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added 10 rare chemical properties. One rare property will now spawn in clearance level 3 and 4 chemicals at a 30% and 100% rate respectively, to make them extra special. Inspiration from #8914 by Watermelon914.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Hyposprays now have an internal vial that it uses as a magazine. This can be ejected after unlocking the hypospray with a screwdriver. You can still fill the hypospray directly if it has a vial in it, which will technically just transfer to the vial instead.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now add autoinjectors to vial boxes. The research centrifuge can now be used to fill autoinjectors. Boxes of empty autoinjectors has been added to research.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The research centrifuge will now only fill everything in the centrifuge uniquely if the input container has more than one chemical. Otherwise it will try to fill everything up.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Russian Red can no longer be a chemical component. Reported by Jaio Acex, #10603.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Made the bonemending property more reliable.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The trigger thresholds for mixing explosive and hyperthermic research chemicals is now determined by the OD threshold.</li>
