			<h3 class="author">Awan updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">The smart disc timer is now separate from the create crystal timer.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Big self-destruct should now work properly.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased harpoon throwing damage.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Hunting traps take time to setup now.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Cakey updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Xenos who are not fire immune will no longer recover health when on fire.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Xenomorph Hive Structures have been added to the game. Special construction nodes can be built by builder castes, leaders, or the queen depending on the desired restriction set by the queen at any time. Most structures require special hive weeds to be built and require Plasmagas as a construction resource, which can be gathered and delivered to construction nodes by builder castes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Plasmagas to the game. Plasmagas is a resource found on key locations of the map and can be gathered by both factions to give them advantages on the field.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added hive collectors, built by the resin construction ability when targetting a resource node or a tile with a resource node present. Gathers 1 resource per 10 seconds and puts it into the hive resource pool.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Plasmagas nodes will span in three categories, Hive, LZ, and Primary nodes will spawn depending on events triggered during the round.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hive resource nodes will appear after the first hive core has been built, selecting whichever node is closest to the hive position.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">LZ resource nodes will appear next to whichever landing zone was picked by the marines at the start of the round, after the takeoff cooldown has passed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Primary resource nodes will appear in central and key positions in the map, and will start appearing after 25 minutes have passed. Once a primary node has been depleted, depending on the player population, a new primary node will appear closer to whichever faction has gathered the least resources.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the ability to see resource node locations via the hive and command tacmaps.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the hive core, a hive structure that acts as a centrepiece to all hives by growing hive weeds and stockpiling Plasmagas.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the hive pylon, a remote structure that also grows hive weeds in a smaller radius as well as acting as a remote location from the hive to build hive structures and access the hive Plasmagas stockpile.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hive pylons and cores will strengthen celings above them by 1 to 2 levels if the area they encompass is already rooved. This will stop air support from being effective around hive locations.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the spawn pool, a hive structure that can be fed bursted corpses in order to respawn a single xenomorph that was killed in action. Spawning can be disrupted by either killing the queen or destroying the pool.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the egg morpher, a hive structure that can be fed bursted corpses in order to generate a total of 6 facehuggers (per corpse) gradually without the need of an egg. Also fires at intruders in a larger radius than normal eggs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the evolution pod, a hive structure that offers a bonus of 0.2 evolution per tick to all xenomorphs on weeds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the recovery node, a hive structure that slowly recovers oen xenomorph at a time when resting adjacent to it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hives will now have a reduced rate of burrowed larvae after 25 minutes into the round. You will need to gain captures in order to efficiently grow your hive.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Default monkey spawns have been reduced from 25 to 5. Extra monkies from survivor spawns have been removed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Young xenomorphs have been made significantly weaker. Later maturations have remained the same stat-wise.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Xenomorph acid splashback no longer stacks and has a cooldown applied before the next splashback can occur.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Multibursting has been removed.</li>

			<h3 class="author">DingleFlop updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">

				<li class="bugfix">The pistol rig can no longer hold the smartpistol. #9361</li>
				<li class="bugfix">WestonMed plus will now vend tricord autoinjectors, isntead of incorrectly vending tricord hyposprays. #10257</li>

			<h2 class="date">14 February 2020</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Atebite and Cakey updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="experiment">Vehicles have received a major overhaul, and now play very different to what you're used to. Make sure you read the changelog in its entirety to familiarize yourself with how vehicles have changed</li>
				<li class="experiment">Vehicle interiors have been added:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Multitile vehicles now have mapped interiors. Interaction with the vehicle is done by interacting with various objects inside the vehicle</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Interiors typically feature a driver and a gunner seat. To drive the vehicle, buckle into the driver's seat. To... gun, buckle into the gunner's seat. To stop driving/gunning, unbuckle from the seat (i.e. by resisting)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Passengers may enjoy the view by clicking on the viewports inside vehicles</li>
				<li class="tweak">Instead of ejecting people when the vehicle is destroyed, xenos can now enter the vehicle just like humans while they're on help intent, and may do so at any time, even when the vehicle is in working order. Vehicles can be entered and exited by both humans and xenos even when broken</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Vehicles spawn in with locked doors. When you're driving the vehicle, you get a verb that lets you toggle the door locks. You can enter vehicles even when they're locked if you have bridge, brig or crewman access</li>
				<li class="experiment">Vehicles now have momentum:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Vehicles have momentum. This means they'll start slow and pick up speed. Turning the vehicle makes you lose some momentum. You cannot immediately go in the reverse direction if you have momentum, but attempting to move in reverse will "brake" the vehicle and allow you to begin reversing faster</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you crash while the vehicle has momentum, unbuckled mobs and unanchored items will be sent flying</li>
				<li class="experiment">Hardpoints now function differently:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Reloading hardpoints is now done by using the weapons loader inside the vehicle. To load ammo into a gun, click on the weapons loader while holding the ammo. To reload the gun, click on the weapons loader with an empty hand</li>
				<li class="tweak">Vehicle hardpoints are now restricted by a firing arc. The firing arc varies from weapon to weapon</li>
				<li class="experiment">Vehicle repair and maintenance is now different:</li>
				<li class="tweak">Hardpoint slot repairs have been replaced with frame repairs</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When all hardpoints are broken, the vehicle frame will begin taking damage. Hardpoints cannot be installed on a broken vehicle frame</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Xenos can force their way into framebroken vehicles from anywhere, not only the vehicle entrances</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Crushers can move framebroken vehicles by charging into them</li>
				<li class="experiment">The tank has been reworked:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The tank now has a mapped interior. You can enter the tank the same way as before. The tank can fit 2 marines</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The tank's turret can now rotate independently of the rest of the tank. To operate the turret, buckle into the gunner's seat inside the tank</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The tank's turret features a gyroscopic lock, which will prevent it from rotating along with the vehicle</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The tank's turret is now a hardpoint. You can install it onto and remove it from the tank by using a powerloader</li>
				<li class="tweak">Primary and secondary hardpoints are now installed on the tank's turret, meaning the tank must have a turret installed in order to install primary/secondary hardpoints</li>
				<li class="tweak">Projectiles shot from the tank's primary weapon now begin traveling 1 tile out from the tank</li>
				<li class="experiment">APCs have been added:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The APC has been added. It's faster than the tank and can fit more marines inside, but has worse firepower. The stock APC can fit 10 marines, including the driver/gunner</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a medical APC. It has a surgery table and sleeper inside, and can fit 5 marines, including the driver/gunner</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a command APC. It has an overwatch console inside, and can fit 5 marines inside, including the driver/gunner</li>
				<li class="experiment">The tank bay has been changed:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Instead of there being a broken tank in the vehicle bay, there's now a ASRS elevator which you can order one vehicle from. You can order equipment from the vendor after ordering a vehicle</li>
				<li class="maptweak">The tank bay has been replaced with a ASRS elevator for vehicles</li>
				<li class="experiment">Other miscellaneous changes:</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tank Crewman has been renamed to Vehicle Crewman</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added a powerloader to the vehicle bay</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed some odd behavior related to rollerbed movement</li>
				<li class="tweak">Flare guns will now always hit the clicked target provided that there's a clear line of sight</li>

				<li class="tweak">Increased number of huggers that carrier can store up to 20 on ancient level.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased number of eggs that carrier can store.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed Eggsac Carrier Strain.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Shaman Carrier Strain. Shamans lose all abilities besides picking eggs up and lose ability to carry huggers. Shamans cannot be affected by pheromones, no matter the level or type.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Shamans have special abilities, all of which share following features: They have windup (delay before effect starts), they work proportionally to amount of non-Shaman xenos in radius (currently currently 3/3.5/3.75/4), they do not work on Shamans, they have common cooldown of 40/30/25/20 seconds (so if you use one ability, you can't use others for that amount of seconds), and MOST IMPORTANTLY they consume an egg to cast an ability. If there is no non-Shaman xenos near to you, effect is cancelled but resources are used.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">First Shaman ability is Adrenal Healing (100). After channeling for 2.5 seconds, Shaman affects in radius 3 all other non-Shaman xenos of their hive by giving them overhealth for 30 seconds, repairing their armor, and unstunning them. Effect is proportional to number of xenos after channeling. No more than 25% of armor integrity will be restored. Minimal effect is 10% for every, if only one other xeno was near you.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Second Shaman ability is Frenzied Scream (300). After channeling for 3 seconds, Shaman affects all xenos FROM OTHER HIVES and all humans by applying a 4 second (endurance may lower this time) knockdown and forcing humans to roll (it will extinguish fire and acid if you are lucky). The radius starts at 3 tiles from Shaman if Shaman has 1 non-Shaman xenomorph nearby, and increases by 0.5 tiles per nearby xeno, up to limit of 7. This ability cannot hit same target more than once in 20 seconds. It also won't affect recently screeched by queen targets.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Third Shaman ability is Adrenal Pheromones (300). After channeling for 2.5 seconds Shaman starts emitting ALL pheromones with effect starting at 1 (lowest level) when 1 non-Shaman xeno is nearby, and with 0.5 increase per xeno, it stops at 5 (ancient empress level). This pheromone emitting stays for 30 seconds after which it expires. Reminder: Pheromones DO NOT WORK ON SHAMANS.</li>
