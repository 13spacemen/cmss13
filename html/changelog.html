		<li class='rscadd'>Nerfed the Cargo Tug Train in a few ways. Xenos can click on it to unbuckle humans, and there's a 50% chance the human will fall flat on their face (even just getting off of it normally. Heh.). Decreased battery efficiency. Starts with a less powerful battery. Removed infinite capacity power cell.</li>

	<h3 class='author'>Abbysynth updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>Distress calls are now available via the comms console, using a CO-level ID. It becomes available for use after at least an hour has passed, with a certain ratio of xenos to humans. Admins can also call it whenever. Distress calls aren't always helpful! Ghosts who are around when it is called can use Join Response Team to join it, but you have to be ghosted for a certain amount of time. It's probably very buggy as it's fairly complex code so please post on the forums if it breaks horribly (which it undoubtedly will).</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 class='author'>Rahlzel updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>New item: "Lazarus Landing Map". It opens a small window showing the satellite view of LV-426. The same map can be seen on the front page of our wiki. The map item looks like a set of green blueprints. There is one in each Squad Leader room, a few on the bridge, and a few more strewn around the station.</li>

		<li class='tweak'>Flashlights (not weapon lights) are slightly brighter.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Crushers are no longer immune to severe-damage explosions (ones that would gib a normal xeno). It instead does a shitload of damage, probably enough to kill them anyway.</li>

	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='tweak'>Players will no longer be forced into a chestbursting Xeno larva. If you have your preference to be a Xeno turned off, the only time you might be a Xeno is if the gamemode forces you to be one at round-start because it didn't find enough Xeno players. In order to become a Xeno after the round starts, you must have your Xeno candidacy enabled. This can be done at round-start by setting "Be Xeno" to "Yes", or by using Preferences > Toggle SpecialRole Candidacy > Xenomorph to "ON".</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>...However, infected hosts who have their Xeno candidacy turned OFF and there are no observer candidates to take control of the chestbursting larva (thus causing the host to stall chestbursting) will have a new challenge to contend with while the fully-grown larva sits in their chest cavity.</li>

		<li class='tweak'>Xenos no longer have X-ray vision. Sorry xenos. You knew it was coming. They do however have the ability to see mobs through walls.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Pheromones! Drones, carriers, hivelords, praetorians, and Queens now have the ability to emit specific types of pheromones -- frenzy, guard, and recovery. Any xeno in range is affected by the pheromones automatically; it drains plasma to use but doesn't negate plasma regen entirely. Frenzy increases speed, claw damage, and tackle chance, guard increases explosion resistance and reduces damage by a %, and recovery increases healing and plasma regen. The effects generally do not stack. You can see if you're being affected by it in the Stat panel.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Overwatch strikes have a slightly higher radius on the 2nd and 3rd strikes.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Crushers now have a much higher chance of knocking over turrets if they ram them.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Runners now lose plasma regen when hiding behind stuff.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Strong-level corrosive melty acid now should work correctly, it was using the default speed values. It will now melt stuff roughly 5 times faster. But nobody gets it yet. </li>
		<li class='tweak'>Praetorians now have medium-speed acid, same as the Queen.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>New xeno caste in IN. But not available to play yet, as we test them. Soon! (tm)</li>

		<li class='bugfix'>Some odd bugs with dropped items are fixed. This MIGHT have broken even more things, so please be on alert for weirdness with dropped or equipped items, particularly flashlights and self-deleting objects like grabs or twohanded items.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Items should now however drop and calculate properly when you're tackled, pounced, throw an item, or it's dropped from damaged hands (smartgun in particular).</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Removed xeno hud for oxygen, plasma gas, and fire. They weren't actually being used anyway (except fire, which was buggy).</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Flamethrowers no longer amplify their sound when fired (it was playing it overtop of itself for each person in sight)</li>

		<li class='bugfix'>A bug was making all projectiles check accuracy due to distance at 50% more than their actual range. Fixed! Guns should miss a lot less often in general now.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Sentry guns are now moveable with a screwdriver (actually in last update)</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Four sentry guns now spawn on the front of the shuttle. These are special immobile ones, they cannot be screwdrivered nor controlled, but come with good power cells and 900 rounds of ammo. They can be recharged and refilled like other sentries.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>RESTRICTED queen toggle no longer reduces damage by half, instead it does not allow slashing if: the xeno is over 2/3rds max health, or if the target is a host.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Human body parts in general are tougher, it takes more damage to get them to a critical state, and having broken hands does not always drop your items all the time (it's instead a random chance).</li>

		<li class='tweak'>Slight change to how projectiles work. They should no longer hit adjacent things at all. Specifically this will make sentry guns work better, but you should also see improvements with regular firearms and xeno spits.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Bunch of bugs related to sentries have been hopefully fixed.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Sentry guns now come equipped with IFF transponders that will fire through friendlies, like a smartgun. Woo!</li>

	<h3 class='author'>Rahlzel updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>New Ghost/Observer verb (in the Ghost tab): "Join as Larva". Allows you (as an Observer) to take over the body of an existing, alive Larva that has been disconnected for 10 minutes, only if you haven't ghosted/suicided/died within 10 minutes yourself.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Admins: New variable for all mobs that might come in handy: "away_timer". Increments approximately once per second when a mob's client is null. Resets to 0 when the mob's client is not null. E.g., away_timer = 127 means the client has been null for 127 seconds. Note: The original client might still be in-game as a ghost or cloned into a different body - just THAT mob has not had a client controlling it for [away_timer] seconds.</li>

The first two can be used on a wide variety of guns, quickfire can go on M41, M39, M4A3, and 44 magnum, compensator can go on M37 and M42C.
