		<li class='soundadd'>Large sound update focused on Xenos. 60+ new sounds - slashing metal, slashing flesh, building resin, breaking resin as a human, eggs destroyed, growls, bites, tail attacks, charging as a Crusher/Queen, buttoning up humans into nests, acid sizzling when an object is destroyed, 6 new roars, and more.</li>
		<li class='soundadd'>Xenos - check the IC > Emotes verb or type *help in chat to see all the new emotes. They have been split up to allow players to pick and choose their favorite emote (hiss1, hiss2, etc) or you can simply use an emote without a number to have the game choose randomly for you (hiss). Remember, these can also be added <a href="http://www.colonial-marines.com/wiki/Macros">as a macro</a> for a bit more personalization (just don't spam them please).</li>

		<li class='rscadd'>Combat Medics now have Medevac Stretchers in their prep rooms.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>New dropship equipment: Medevac System. It's installed at the rear attach point instead of the crewserved MG. It is used in combination with medic's medevac stretcher to evacuate a wounded marine or a marine in a cryobag to the Dropship. The Medevac works as follows: a medic unfolds their medevac stretcher in a non-underground location on the planet, they buckle a marine or a bodybag/cryobag to the stretcher, they activate the stretcher's beacon via rightclick and wait. The dropship pilots now fly their dropship in 'flyby' flight, when in the air they use their console to select an activated stretcher, then they must go to the back of the dropship and click the Medevac System to activate its winch that will grab the stretcher, deliver its content to the dropship and drop the stretcher back to its original spot. The Medevac System has a cooldown of 1 minute between each use. Only Pilots can use the Medevac System, and only medically trained personnel can activate the stretcher's beacon.</li>

		<li class='rscadd'>The Xenomorph Queen gameplay is overhauled. You no longer click an ability to lay eggs, you now use an actual ovipositor. The "lay egg" ability is replaced by a "grow ovipositor" ability. Once your ovipositor is grown you cannot move and your abilities changes. The Queen now passively lay eggs and those eggs must be picked up and planted on weeds by the hive castes (Drone, Hivelord, Carrier, Queen). The planted eggs start already grown. The Queen gains new ability when in egg laying mode. She can toggle a wider vision mode and she can overwatch a xenomorph. The Queen pheromones are stronger and affect all xenomorphs when in egg-laying mode. The Queen can detach herself from the ovipositort. After that, the Queen must wait 5 minutes before being able to grow a new ovipositor. The Xenomorphs evolution progress stop when the Queen is not in egg-laying mode.</li>

You now activate the ability like Pounce, select the ability and click a target to transfer a fixed plasma amount to another xeno at a certain range after a small delay. Hivelord transfers more plasma, at longer range, and faster.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Secrete Resin is now an active ability, like Pounce, it uses shift click or middle click. Hivelords can now secrete resin on tiles adjacent to them. They can also upgrade existing resin structures to their stronger version if it exists. Hivelord's Secrete Resin cost is increased.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Xeno abilities are now using action buttons, just like items like marine armor light. Most of those abilities are removed from the Alien tab in the top right corner, which means no more macro with those abilities. Some of those abilities can now be selected via their button and then used using middle click or shift click (Pounce, Stomp, Spit, Charge, etc). The 'secrete resin' ability is now split into two: 'choose resin' to select which type of resin structure you want to secrete, and 'secrete resin' to actually build that structure. Secreting resin now takes time, something around 1 second (and less for the Hivelord). Toggling dark vision is now a button next to the health and plasma. </li>

	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>Various sound-related verbs in the Preferences (everyone) and Fun (Admins only) tabs have been improved:</li>
		<li><u>For all players</u> - Admin midis can still be permanently turned on/off via the Character Setup screen (or in Ghost > Edit Characters if you're observing). However, if you have admin midis enabled and an Admin plays a sound, you can use the new <b>Silence Current Midi</b> verb in the Preferences tab to forcibly stop hearing it. Additionally, a message is sent to staff when a player uses this verb within 30 seconds of a midi playing, letting us know that a player has silenced it. This is to give us a better idea of which sounds/midis are favorable over others. The goal is to improve immersion by teaching staff to play immersive, favorable songs and sounds while the game is played. For this reason, we're hoping those of you with Admin midis turned off will now turn them on in your Character Setup screen in order to take part.</li>
		<li><u>For Staff with the Fun tab</u> - "Play Global Sound" and "Play Local Sound" have been replaced by <b>Play Imported Sound</b> and <b>Play Sound From List</b>. The former will allow importing any sound from anywhere on your computer and then tells all connected clients to download and then play it (the way "Play Global Sound" used to work). The latter will display a list of server sounds and music that are already in the project and do not need to be downloaded by anyone. Obviously, "Play Sound From List" is preferred, and this can and will grow as we add more immersive music to the project (within reason - we don't want gigabytes worth of music). Both verbs now have "Global" or "Local" as secondary options when playing a sound, and both will show how many players are hearing it.</li>
		<li class='soundadd'>Also, Power Loader footstep sounds are now much more accurate.</li>

		<li class='rscadd'>The two dropships can now be equipped with weapons and electronics. Equipments can be found in the rooms next to the hangar, and it can be loaded with the new powerloaders. Pilots can now fire those weapons at ground targets identified with a laser. Squad Leaders can now laser targets with their binoculars by double clicking. The target must be in open ground, just like the orbital beacon. The laser takes a few second to appear and will disappear if the SL does not stand still. Target lasers will automatically disappear after 60 seconds. Pilots can now choose between two flight types: * TRANSPORT which is the one everyone knows, that moves between the Almayer and the ground planet, and * FIRE MISSION which allows you to detect laser targets on the ground and fire the dropship weapons at those targets, the dropship lands back where it started. So if you launched a fire mission from the almayer you will land back on the almayer after the fixed duration of the fire mission flight.</li>

		<li class='tweak'>False walls have been restored, along with everything associated with girders - metal needed returned to 2, time to build a wall returned to 8. Thanks for the constructive criticism (http://www.colonial-marines.com/viewtopic.php?f=64&t=12048). We'll look into some good alternatives and in the future disable false walls at the same time as having a good replacement.</li>

	<h2 class='date'>2 April 2017</h2>
	<h3 class='author'>Rahlzel updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='tweak'>When players come to a locked airlock, most of the time they'll just deconstruct the wall beside it since the airlock itself takes some time to hack and deconstructing the wall only takes 2 quick steps - welder and wrench. We're changing this to be more in line with realism and, as a bonus, making Squad Engineers more useful as airlock hackers. As a result several things have changed:</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Normal (non-reinforced) walls now take 7 steps to deconstruct them instead of 2. Deconstruction starts the same way - with a lit welder - and the wall can be examined during the entire process to visually see which tool needs to be used next to continue. This will help prevent wiki-checking during normal gameplay. Also note that damaged walls must be repaired first (also with a welder) before they can be neatly deconstructed. This will all happen automagically just by hitting a wall with a lit welder - it will either start repair or start deconstruction.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Wall building/construction has been made a bit tougher in order to balance the realism of it now taking longer to deconstruct a wall. Walls now use 5 metal sheets on a girder instead of 2, and the time it takes to finish construction has been increased from 8 seconds to 30 seconds.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>False walls have been removed. We debated this to some extent and ultimately came to the conclusion that an entire wall sliding in and out is not exactly canon or even realistic (it's also simply old Baycode that we just haven't dealt with yet). We are considering alternatives, however, such as a barricade "gate" that slides open and closed, or allowing marines to be more nimble by jumping over any barricade (including flipped ones) after a brief cooldown.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Unrelated, but noteworthy: The Chem Dispenser's access requirements are now working correctly, which means that Squad Medics no longer have access to them. The Chemist/Doctor/Researcher/CMO watching his or her Chem Dispenser getting raided each round can now feel useful again.</li>
		<li>Thanks to forwardslashN for assistance with the above, and to Artouris for the April Fools update yesterday. The ocean-biomed "Nostromo" and "Old Sulaco" maps were quite popular, so we'll keep them and run them once in a while for fun and nostalgia. For those new to the community, they are based on our original 2 maps that were our first ones several years ago. You can read more about them here: http://www.colonial-marines.com/wiki/History#Pre-Alpha_Maps</li>

		<li class='rscadd'>Overhauled fire, all fire based weapons now actually function like fire based weapons.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>M240A1 Incinerator Units have been removed from Spec vendors and placed into SL vendors. SLs are expected to distribute them to the squad. Two in each SL vendor, four tanks for each. These tanks come with their own special fuel and will no longer accept phoron. You can eventually subsitute it with welding fuel from fuel dispensers if you run out of the original fuel. Use unique action to light the flamer, and should handle like a regular gun for the most part.</li>

		<li class='tweak'>WO secondary defenses have been changed to help prevent xenos beelining to the Outpost itself; Also prevent xenos from blowing up secondary line defenses from behind.</li>

Hostile ERTs, and other ERTs that wouldn't normally have this access, do not. Nightmare PMCs have their own access, but lack this  one. They do have it when spawning as an ERT. It is not possible to change what access a weapon will require, nor is it possible to add anything other than the marine identification access through the identification console. This will eventually be replaced with a much better system. Remember, only turrets check for PDAs as a courtesy so you don't just get shot into oblivion on the Sulaco as a doctor.</li>

		<li class='tweak'>Xeno Drones are now able to upgrade and can still evolve into a Queen as needed. However, upgraded Drones can ONLY evolve into a Queen and not to any other caste.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>In an attempt to offset the "metarushing" happening on LV-624 (Marines running to the caves too early), rather than adding yet another foolish, variably-interpreted rule (cough), we are working on an updated version of LV-624 that will completely prevent it. In the meantime, the cave areas in the current LV-624 have been fully furnished with dozens more resin nodes, resin doors, and nest areas to help starting Xeno teams defend somewhat comfortably immediately when the round starts.</li>
		<li>In other news, a fixed version of Ice Colony will be arriving soon(TM), perhaps within a week or two. We recognize that one of our biggest issues right now is the need for a change of scenery with new maps and an easy way for players to choose them, so those are near the top of our list.</li>

		<li class='rscadd'>The "bioscans" that Admins commonly give out have now been automated. They first arrive after 1 hour and repeat every 30 minutes. The Xenos receive a similar message from the <a href='http://avp.wikia.com/wiki/Queen_Mother'>Queen Mother</a>, which in Alien lore is an extremely powerful Xeno that ranks above all Queens and Empresses with enough telepathic power to reach across entire galaxies. The more you know. For marines, the bioscan of the ship is exact, but for the planet and elsewhere it's slightly inaccurate. For Xenos, the Queen Mother message for the planet is exact, but for the "metal hive" and elsewhere it's slightly inaccurate. We feel this change will help against long, drawn-out rounds when one side camps even though there's only a few enemies left because they don't know how many enemies there are.

	</ul>
	<h3 class='author'>forwardslashN updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed incorrect damage calculations on armor... What this means: armor will generally protect you a little better from FF and  other firearm related injury. It will also have a far higher chance of negating small arms fire (handguns/SMGs) the majority of  the time. Rifles and the like will still make you hurt, a lot. </li>

		<li class='bugfix'>Some misc gun fixes and consistency tweaks.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed sadar speed calculations.</li>
		<li class='experiment'>A bunch of efficiency changes related to the gun system. Probably won't be noticable too much in general, but will be noticable  during heavy firefights. It's pretty much as lag free at this point as it gets. Hopefully.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>I rewrote bipods since their functions were disabled with the gun update. They will work as follows: You activate attachment if  you want to get into a position to use the bipod. If it finds something, you will get a message. If you are already in a position  to shoot and keep that position, or it doesn't find anything, it will instead activate your other attachments. When you shoot and  you are not in the right position, the bipod will "deactivate" automatically and you can try and get into a new position. You have  to be facing the same way as you did when you established a position for the bipod, among other things. It should be fairly  logical. Bipods work with tables, racks, and metal barricades, though there may be a few others I'm not aware of. Should work fine  regardless. Bipods no longer provide bonuses at all unless they are used in a position, but firing them in position is very  beneficial.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Tweaked buckshot.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Tweaked slug speed.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Tweaked sniper bullet speed.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Tweaked some distress equipment spawns.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Tweaked predator storage slots.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Rockets changed again. Explosive rockets will always explode on the tile of the clicked target. AP and WP rockets will always fly  straight unless shooting a downed person or some such. AP and WP rockets must hit the target to do any real damage.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Silencers will now give a different firing sound and hide muzzle flash. They now decrease damage a tad, but give increased  accuracy and less recoil. Not as great as recoil comp/extended though.</li>

Defibs are considered to be quite overpowered, so there is a limit to their usage (about 10 uses per defib - some of which will fail). Also, they cannot be recharged, so the ones you start with are all you have. However, we're still open to discussion regarding them and anything else on our forum.

		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed some missing ammo mags and minor graphical problems. Not everything though.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed snipers and burst fire. You cannot attach a burst fire assembly to the sniper now, as it won't work with the new burst  system.</li>

		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed bullets getting stuck in mid air when fired from attachments. Might be more of these, report as they happen.</li>

		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed sentries. Sentries won't shoot you if you have an ID in hand or in a pda, or both. Smartgun bullets still don't take this into consideration.</li>

		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed xeno not properly doing burn damage.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed guns and ammo not having research levels set. They're all proper now.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed shotguns breaking on point blank.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed an issue with xeno spits barely doing any damage to turrets.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed guns firing on burst when dropped.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed issues with suicide with a gun and point blanking.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed/rewrote point blanking. Aside from not breaking anymore, it also takes into account all bonuses and never misses.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed rockets going into pockets/belts... Also fixed rocket launchers not taking the right ammo.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed sadars being able to fire on the Sully.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed tasers not going into charging ports. You can recharge them proper now.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed wooden barricades not being damaged by bullets or other projectiles.</li>

		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed buckshot hitting you, the shooter, when close enough.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed closet health and them getting destroyed with any sort of projectile. Like a taser.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed rockets going into belts and such.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Regular magazine-fed guns now chamber rounds as they do in real life (those that actually do that). This change won't effect much, but you can now fire  off a mag and still have a bullet to fire in the chamber. Or reload with the chambered round. Every time you reload a mag, you  will cock the weapon if there's nothing chambered.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Attachments that you can fire will now tell you if they are empty or not.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>If you only have one attachment that can activate on your gun (ie, launcher/scope), you will auto select it istead of a menu.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Masterkey shotgun and any future attachables that use bullets can now make casings (if they are not caseless). You can also attach it to the pump shotty.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>You can now suicide with attachables, if they shoot bullets. Specifically the masterkey, but it also applies to anything else that is added in the future.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Masterkey shotgun now has 5 shots instead of 4.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Attached flamers now have a range of 5 tiles instead of 2.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Stocks now fit the A/2 rifle. No reason they shouldn't. Takes the same attachments as the regular MK2.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Elite M39s now take the same attachments as the regular version. Same reason.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Shotguns now have 25 shells per box, enough for five handfuls. There are also less boxes per vendor. All shotguns will accept handfuls of ammo, so it doesn't matter what box you got it from (keep clicking on the shotgun to reload shell by shell). You can also load different types of ammo into the shotgun, and it will fire them in sequence, starting with the last loaded.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Shotguns adjusted. Slugs behave like regular bullets, but do more damage (they had damage fallout before, losing damage as they  travelled) with good armor penetration. Buckshot has very short range, but it does massive damage up-close, and quickly loses  damage the more it travels.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Revolvers behave differently. You won't eject the mag when you run out of bullets. You will instead eject all the spent casings  and any bullets you have not fired (in the form of a handful) once you manually empty the gun. Once the revolver is empty, you may  reload it with a speedloader. You may instead reload it the revolver with a handful of ammo. You can also click a speedloader with  an empty hand to make a handful of ammo out of it. You may instead click a speedloader with a handful of ammo to reload it. You  can transfer ammo between handfuls of the same type, but you cannot mix them together for the sake of sanity. Unload (or click the  revolver with itself) to close the cylinder and fire. You can also spin the cylinder with use unique action if you want to play  Russian Roulette.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>All revolvers now fit the belt.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Smartgun will attempt to auto-reload roughly every 20 bullets fired. Any time you try to reload manually, this number will be  reset. If you stand still, you can constinuously fire until you run dry.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Smartgun now has a safety feature. Altclick it to toggle shooting any targets in your way or ignoring friendlies.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Renamed the M41A to M41A MK2. Just a cosmetic difference.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>The Russian variant of the Korovin can take the same attachments and both are properly silenced.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Some misc changes to a few guns in terms of attachments.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Guns now don't immediately tell you how much ammo they have upon examine unless they have an ammo counter, like the pulse rifle.  Smartguns are exempt.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Added two new guns that are inaccesible for now.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>The replica katana is now a real weapon that is okay for real combat. Beware the samurai.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Finished implementing spent casings for guns that use them. This won't impact 95% of the game, but cool to have when the Bears  show up.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Minigun fixed and made significantly stronger. You have been warned.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Adjusted the muzzle flash to be a bit offset, to make it better looking.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Some guns won't automatically eject the mag. Mostly shotguns, revolvers, and a few misc guns not commonly available to marines.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Nerfed the merc shotgun to burstfire less.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Removed Russian guns from RO. Turns out you weren't supposed to have access to them.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Autolathes won't eat material for regular stacks of metal/glass. So you'll get the same number of mats back if you try to print  sheets.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>You can now burst fire right after reloading. You can also shoot grenades/flame/masterkey while the gun is empty or after  reloading.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>You can unload two handed weapons by holding them in your inactive hand then clicking them with your active hand. You'll take out  the mag.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Small predator weapon change.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Predators can shoot while cloaked. This is meant to incite terror and ward off enemies. Not to kill. If you abuse this, you will be removed.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Added muzzle flash to turrets.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Updated UI icons for various gun switches and added a new one. It's called Use Unique Action and it will allow you to pump  shotguns instead of the pump shotgun verb, along with other gun specific unique actions.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Added a scope category to attachable vendor. It starts with zero, but can be restocked.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Load bearing equipment now has 4 slots instead of 3.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Some guns can no longer point blank. Mostly snipers/smartgun/a few others. If they're really big or energy based, don't expect  them to point blank.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Added safety toggle to guns. alt+click to toggle it on or off. Default is off.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>The taser has 10 shots now, instead of near infinite shots (500).</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Adjusted tables to take more damage from bullets.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Adjusted plasma caster projectile speeds.</li>
		<li class='soundadd'>Added some new weapon sounds courtesy of Rahlzel, including some new attachable sounds.</li>
		<li class='wip'>Handfuls and bullet casings may change icon when thrown. I am working on a fix, so try not to throw them around.</li>
		<li class='wip'>Sadars may puff in strange and unexpected directions. Working on a fix.</li>
		<li class='wip'>Bipods DO NOT WORK. They still provide static bonuses, but their code to use barricades DOES NOT WORK. I will enable it when I find a good solution.</li>

		<li class='tweak'>Shotguns now have an alternate method of reloading: If you are carrying a box of shells of the same type that's already loaded, you can quickly top up the loaded one with the one in hand. It can be paused at any time as it feeds shells in, but you still can't load multiple varieties of ammo into the same mag.</li>

The way Hunter Games works is, you ready up, get spawned into LV624 amidst a huge pile of random stuff. Then you fight it out until there's only one left standing! The last survivor has their name kept in the server logs forever. Glory!</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Xeno HP has been nerfed slightly across the board. Some castes have had armor values increased to compensate, some had no HP nerf, and some got double whammied. Expect balance to be tweaked until I'm satisfied we can get maximum bloodshed from both teams. And don't fret, coming up next is the big xeno rewrite..</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Crushers lose a bit of stomp radius.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Bunch of cargo crates fixed with better stuff.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Predators are losing hellhounds for now, but are gaining new cool upgrades for their bracers, including a universal translator and a sick new wristblade. Expect to see and play hellhounds in the Hunter Games!</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Way way more! If you find new bugs please post them on the forums.</li>

		<li>Observer improvements in "Ghost" tab:</li>
        <li class='rscadd'>New verb: Follow Xeno. Shows a list of living Xenos that are playing.</li>
        <li class='tweak'>Combined "Join as Larva" and "Join as Alien" into one verb: "Join as Xeno".</li>
        <li class='tweak'>Reduced maximum rejoin time from from 20 minutes to 10 minutes and reduced the minimum from 10 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Explanation: If you die in any form (or join as an Observer), you must wait for a 5 minute "death timer" (reduced from 10) before respawning as a Xeno. If a Xeno player leaves a living body (disconnect, ghost, etc), that body will begin an "away timer" for 5 minutes (also reduced from 10) before it is available for observers to join (they might reconnect). Therefore, the minimum and maximum time needed to wait before rejoining as an available Xeno is 5-10 minutes.
        <li class='rscadd'>Reminder for Admins: Spawned Larva using the Game Panel will immediately be ready for any observer to enter them (so long as their death timer is 5+ minutes). This can be useful for events and rewards for the Xeno team.</li>

XENOS: HERE IS WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT PREDATORS: You usually call them the HEAD TAKERS, or the invisible ones, or something along those lines. Yautja is also acceptable.

Xenos can click on it to unbuckle humans, and there's a 50% chance the human will fall flat on their face (even just getting off of it normally. Heh.). Decreased battery efficiency. Starts with a less powerful battery. Removed infinite capacity power cell.</li>

		<li class='rscadd'>Distress calls are now available via the comms console, using a CO-level ID. It becomes available for use after at least an hour has passed, with a certain ratio of xenos to humans. Admins can also call it whenever. Distress calls aren't always helpful! Ghosts who are around when it is called can use Join Response Team to join it, but you have to be ghosted for a certain amount of time. It's probably very buggy as it's fairly complex code so please post on the forums if it breaks horribly (which it undoubtedly will).</li>

		<li class='tweak'>Players will no longer be forced into a chestbursting Xeno larva. If you have your preference to be a Xeno turned off, the only time you might be a Xeno is if the gamemode forces you to be one at round-start because it didn't find enough Xeno players. In order to become a Xeno after the round starts, you must have your Xeno candidacy enabled.
