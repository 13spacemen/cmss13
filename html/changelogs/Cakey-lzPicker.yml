changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added the ability to select primary landing zones. Dropship consoles have been added to LZ2 on all maps and will now only allow the Xenomorph Queen to interact with them if designated as primary LZ. The primary LZ can be selected from the CO's communications console. Primary LZ is defaulted to LZ1 25 minutes into the round."
  - tweak: "The maintenance doors at LZ2 on Ice can now be melted after being opened by marines."
