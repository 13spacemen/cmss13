changes: 
  - bugfix: "Fixed reagent containers showing reagent id instead of name on examine."
  - bugfix: "Fixed some runtimes regarding catalysts."
  - bugfix: "Fixed oxycodone being no stronger than tramadol. Damn those budget cuts..."
  - bugfix: "CL Can no longer use the chem dispenser."
  - tweak: "Increased researcher slots from 1 to 2 during lowpop and 2 to 3 during highpop."
  - tweak: "The surgery skill has been divided into 4 levels instead of 2. Surgery speed of everyone is unaffected by this except for:"
  - tweak: "Researchers are now slightly slower at surgery than doctors to emphasize the role getting more purpose."
  - tweak: "1st generation synths are now slightly faster at surgery than doctors. Other synth generations remain at CMO speed."
  - tweak: "Researchers, the CMO, synthetics and colony scientists now have a research skill. This skill will allow the use of research machinery."
  - tweak: "You can now dump the contents from plant bags directly into chemistry grinders. (#7008)"
  - tweak: "Added a bog of empty spray bottles to research. (#7238)"
  - imageadd: "Changed vialbox icons into the sprites left behind by NicBoone."
  - maptweak: "Added two more monkey cube boxes to Almayer research. One in the lab and one in the closet."
  - maptweak: "Added boxes with empty vials to Almayer research."
  - maptweak: "Added a body scanner to Almayer research."
  - imageadd: "Added paper sprites with the company's and USCM's logo on it."
  - tweak: "Added a verb to paper bins for switching the secondary paper type. Paper bins on the Almayer have USCM types. Research and the CL office has the company type. You can still switch to carbon-copy by using the verb."
  - tweak: "In paperformatting, you can now use [uscm] to make a USCM logo or [wy] for a company logo. [logo] still works so you don't have to redo all your templates."
  - experiment: "CHEMICAL RESEARCH UPDATE"
  - rscadd: "Added a random chemical generator to CM. This can generate random chemicals with millions of combinations for properties, recipes, names and other stats."
  - rscadd: "Every round, a specific amount of these chemicals will be generated. It is up to the researchers to discover these chemicals and unlock their potential."
  - rscadd: "Generated chemicals can have between 1-4 properties of varying potency, all of which can be any combination of good and bad. Discovering these will require thorough testing."
  - rscadd: "The recipe for all generated chemicals require 3 different components, and maybe an additional catalyst. The components can be anything from iron to souto or even plasma from an alien..."
  - rscadd: "Chemicals with a higher number of properties tend to require more rare components. These may not be something you can get normally. You'll thus have to either retrieve a sample of it from the colony or by using hydroponics."
  - rscadd: "Mutating plants in hydroponics now has a chance to make the plant contain a new chemical. This can also be one of the randomly generated chemicals."
  - rscadd: "An XRF Scanner has been added to Almayer research. Those trained in research can use this to analyze the composition of a chemical sample."
  - rscadd: "Chemicals scanned by the XRF might be something it can't identify. This means you have to obtain a sample of this first and scan that."
  - rscadd: "Identifying a new chemical will give DEFCON, with more points from rare ones. You know this when the XRF prints: Saved emission spectrum of..."
  - rscadd: "Note: The XRF does not analyze the properties of a chemical. But will print any infomation it might have in its database."
  - tweak: "Updated the description of most chemicals to fit better with the XRF. Not like you could see the descriptions before anyway..."
  - rscadd: "The medical computer can now print scan records onto paper."
  - rscadd: "Research notes describing the random chemicals can now be found around research and administrative areas around maps."
  - rscadd: "Vial boxes with random chemicals can now be found in research areas around maps."
  - wip: "The above two items have yet to be added to Trijent Dam, as the map is currently undergoing some major changes. But will be added at a later date."
  - tweak: "Researchers now spawn with a random research note. However, this note will only describe one of the simple chemicals. So it is just to get you started."
  - tweak: "Scientist survivors now spawn with a random vial and a research note. Unlike the researcher's, this can be the good stuff too."
