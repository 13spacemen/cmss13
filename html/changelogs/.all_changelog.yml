  TheDonkified:
  - tweak: Ported tg's getFlatIcon proc and modified it a bit to compensate for how
      we use planes and how we handle human overlays.
  - bugfix: Alt-click panel should now update the icon for humans when they put on
      new items and should display their bodies properly now.
  Vanagandr:
  - tweak: Tidied my old hypospray code. Main things are that tactical-reloads only
      swap hands if moving an old vial into the inactive hand, and there's text for
      starting to load a vial into an empty hypo.
  - bugfix: Ghosts and xenos and unconscious people can no longer toggle hypospray
      injection amounts, fixed hypospray tactical-reloading vials out of inventory
      not properly updating the storage screen.

  TheDonkified:
  - bugfix: Full auto works on black tiles now.
  - tweak: M2C will rotate upon click now instead of requiring you to fire first.
  Waltermeldron:
  - bugfix: Changes the bikehorn notification message to an actual sound file.
  - rscadd: Adds the Xenomorph and Marine techtree. Xenomorphs can enter through the
      verb in their alien tab called "Enter Tech Tree" and marines can enter through
      the verb in their "Objects" tab.
  - rscadd: Each techtree has 3 tiers. Marines get 3 different permanent techs per
      tier and some repeatable techs that can be purchased multiple times (req points/OBs).
      Xenos get 2 different permanent techs and 2 different powerups each tier. Powerups
      can be purchased multiple times to provide different temporary/limited use abilities
      and effects.
  - rscadd: The tech tree controller for the marine side is chosen randomly between
      the CO/XO. The controller can choose to hand this power to the other side if
      they so choose using the tech management console in CIC. They cannot be forced
      to give up this power and additionally cannot be forced to purchase any techs
      if the controller is either the CO/XO. If someone else is in control of techwebs,
      a person of a higher ranking may take over by going to this console and using
      it. Leaving the almayer z-level will result in the person in control of techwebs
      to lose their control - You must be on the Almayer z-level to control techwebs.
  - rscadd: Adds a new role called RT Operator. This is a squad role and there is
      2 per squad. The assistant RTO is the second RTO in a squad to spawn in. The
      squad lead succession operates as so; SL -> RTO -> Assistant RTO
  - rscadd: Added telephones. RTOs get a portable telephone on their backpack.
  - rscadd: Added droppods. Drop pods are a way of distributing techs. More drop pods
      (manned drop pod, etc) may be added in the future with this change. RTOs can
      call down any tech drop pods. Drop pods will gib anything they land on.
