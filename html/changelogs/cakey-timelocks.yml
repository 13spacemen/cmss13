changes: 
  - rscadd: "Role timelocks are here. Once enabled, new players will be unable to play as roles they do not meet the playtime requirements to. You will be able to view any unmet requirements for a role in the character creation menu. Additionally, Queen will be timelocked as well (Only for round-start, anyone can still evolve to queen after the round has started). Existing players with playtime in a role will have their roles unlocked without needing to meet any requirements."
  - rscadd: "Added the Senior Enlisted advisor, a mentor-only role dedicated to helping and teaching players about game mechanics, regulations, law, and potentially offering new roleplay opportunities for ship-side roles. SEAs have no combat skills, are ranked E8 GySGT (Gunnery Sergeant), and are old grouches!"
  - rscadd: "SEA players with over 9 hours played will be granted the rank of E9 SGM (Sergeant Major)"
  - rscadd: "Added minimum character ages to certain roles. If your character does not meet the age requirement for the role you are spawned in as, it will be changed to the minimum age."
  - rscadd: "PFC Marines with playtimes under 9 hours will now be given the rank of Private (PVT) to better help players identify those that may be new to the game. Try not to bully the newbies!"
  - rscadd: "Humans will now show their rank next to their name on examine."
  - maptweak: "Added the Senior Enlisted Advisor office near Cryogenics."
