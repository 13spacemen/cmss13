changes: 
  - rscadd: "Handrails, railings, etc now exist. They can be vaulted, reinforced, and melted. They cannot be wired or repaired, even when reinforced. Handrails provide minimal projectile cover."
  - rscadd: "Handrails can be constructed for two metal. They can be reinforced to provide cover and block hostile movement for one metal sheet. Use a welder to secure the reinforcing plate. Use a crowbar to remove it."
  - rscadd: "Handrails can be unsecured and moved with a wrench. Use a screwdriver to deconstruct an unsecured handrail into metal sheets."
  - rscadd: "You can replace the reinforcing metal plate to replenish a handrail's bonus health. Do this by following regular construction methods and cycling the damaged piece out."
  - rscadd: "Tall grass has been adjusted so it is no longer code-unique to Trijent Dam. Expect this gameplay element on other maps in the near future."
  - imageadd: "Added some map variant decals for later use."
