changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added a new objective type - safe cracking. It's a low-value objective meant to give IOs clues as to how to crack open various surface-level safes."
  - bugfix: "Debug controllers verb now lists a few missing controllers."
  - tweak: "Changed how DEFCON percentage display level is calculated in View Objectives Clues and other places. It will be calculated as a ratio of total points gathered vs what you need to unlock the next level (and counting upwards). This means for example once you reach 100% DEFCON 5 you will be dropped to 50% DEFCON 4. This should give everyone a better estimate of how much work is still to be done."
  - tweak: "Survivor rescue objective now handles the fact that Synths can be repaired after death."
  - tweak: "Objectives now have a guaranteed minimal amount of clues generated. Folders and Disks have two, safes have four, experimental items have eight. This will ensure various objectives will be a bit more interconnected and you're less likely to hit a dead end by missing one clue."
