  - rscadd: "L41A Battle Rifle - easy to carry, doesn't slow you down, worse accuracy when wielded than M41A, better accuracy (slightly) when not wielded over M41A. This weapon can't burstfire but can become super precise with the help of attachments."

  - rscadd: "IFTS Mini-Scope - Unique attachment for the Battle Rifle. It allows you to zoom with offset akin to miniscope but has no drawbacks/benefits to accuracy or scatter. Scope also gives a small slowdown to movement speed while scoped in. Scoping in takes up to one second."
  - rscadd: "IFTS Mini-Scope can be only received by taking mini-sniper kit or being Medic/Engineer and picking it as your free attachment."

  - rscadd: "To collapse barricade, drag its deployed sprite onto yourself. Collapsing a barricade takes 10 seconds."
  - rscadd: "Folding Barricades are resistant to acid (cannot be melted), cannot be jumped over (as if they had barbed wire) but do not slash back. They cannot be rotated or moved, they can be only undeployed and then redeployed."
  - rscadd: "Folding Barricades can only be carried in hands or on the back instead of backpack."
