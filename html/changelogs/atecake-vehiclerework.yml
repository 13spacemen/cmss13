changes:
  - experiment: Vehicles have received a major overhaul, and now play very different to what you're used to. Make sure you read the changelog in its entirety to familiarize yourself with how vehicles have changed
  - experiment: "Vehicle interiors have been added:"
  - rscadd: Multitile vehicles now have mapped interiors. Interaction with the vehicle is done by interacting with various objects inside the vehicle
  - rscadd: Interiors typically feature a driver and a gunner seat. To drive the vehicle, buckle into the driver's seat. To... gun, buckle into the gunner's seat. To stop driving/gunning, unbuckle from the seat (i.e. by resisting)
  - rscadd: Passengers may enjoy the view by clicking on the viewports inside vehicles
  - tweak: Instead of ejecting people when the vehicle is destroyed, xenos can now enter the vehicle just like humans while they're on help intent, and may do so at any time, even when the vehicle is in working order. Vehicles can be entered and exited by both humans and xenos even when broken
  - rscadd: Vehicles spawn in with locked doors. When you're driving the vehicle, you get a verb that lets you toggle the door locks. You can enter vehicles even when they're locked if you have bridge, brig or crewman access
  - experiment: "Vehicles now have momentum:"
  - rscadd: Vehicles have momentum. This means they'll start slow and pick up speed. Turning the vehicle makes you lose some momentum. You cannot immediately go in the reverse direction if you have momentum, but attempting to move in reverse will "brake" the vehicle and allow you to begin reversing faster
  - rscadd: If you crash while the vehicle has momentum, unbuckled mobs and unanchored items will be sent flying
  - experiment: "Hardpoints now function differently:"
  - rscadd: Reloading hardpoints is now done by using the weapons loader inside the vehicle. To load ammo into a gun, click on the weapons loader while holding the ammo. To reload the gun, click on the weapons loader with an empty hand
  - tweak: Vehicle hardpoints are now restricted by a firing arc. The firing arc varies from weapon to weapon
  - experiment: "Vehicle repair and maintenance is now different:"
  - tweak: Hardpoint slot repairs have been replaced with frame repairs
  - rscadd: When all hardpoints are broken, the vehicle frame will begin taking damage. Hardpoints cannot be installed on a broken vehicle frame
  - rscadd: Xenos can force their way into framebroken vehicles from anywhere, not only the vehicle entrances
  - rscadd: Crushers can move framebroken vehicles by charging into them
  - experiment: "The tank has been reworked:"
  - rscadd: The tank now has a mapped interior. You can enter the tank the same way as before. The tank can fit 2 marines
  - rscadd: The tank's turret can now rotate independently of the rest of the tank. To operate the turret, buckle into the gunner's seat inside the tank
  - rscadd: The tank's turret features a gyroscopic lock, which will prevent it from rotating along with the vehicle
  - rscadd: The tank's turret is now a hardpoint. You can install it onto and remove it from the tank by using a powerloader
  - tweak: Primary and secondary hardpoints are now installed on the tank's turret, meaning the tank must have a turret installed in order to install primary/secondary hardpoints
  - tweak: Projectiles shot from the tank's primary weapon now begin traveling 1 tile out from the tank
  - experiment: "APCs have been added:"
  - rscadd: The APC has been added. It's faster than the tank and can fit more marines inside, but has worse firepower. The stock APC can fit 10 marines, including the driver/gunner
  - rscadd: Added a medical APC. It has a surgery table and sleeper inside, and can fit 5 marines, including the driver/gunner
  - rscadd: Added a command APC. It has an overwatch console inside, and can fit 5 marines inside, including the driver/gunner
  - experiment: "The tank bay has been changed:"
  - rscadd: Instead of there being a broken tank in the vehicle bay, there's now a ASRS elevator which you can order one vehicle from. You can order equipment from the vendor after ordering a vehicle
  - maptweak: The tank bay has been replaced with a ASRS elevator for vehicles
  - experiment: "Other miscellaneous changes:"
  - tweak: Tank Crewman has been renamed to Vehicle Crewman
  - maptweak: Added a powerloader to the vehicle bay
  - bugfix: Fixed some odd behavior related to rollerbed movement
  - tweak: Flare guns will now always hit the clicked target provided that there's a clear line of sight
