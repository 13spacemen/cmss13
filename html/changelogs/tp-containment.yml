changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added a new objective - alien containment. Works like retrieving xeno corpses, but for living aliens. Put them in your containment cell, keep them alive and they will be worth more points than corpses!"
  - tweak: "Yautja now also count for containment and corpse retrieval. Happy hunting!"
  - tweak: "On the flip side, the research containment will now open if the related terminal gets destroyed, or in an event of a dropship crash. This is to let xenos in containment be rescued without admin intervention, as well as give contained players an opportunity for revenge. ."
