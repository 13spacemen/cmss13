# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - experiment: "Decreased the number of items physically located on maps by merging them into tables and racks."
  - experiment: "Placing most items on tables or racks will now merge the item into it. However, the items should remain as interactable as usual. Holding CTRL while clicking a table or rack with an item will force the item to be placed on the table, rather than trying to click an item on the table."
  - bugfix: "Fixed pixel accurate item placement on tables (yes, apparently we had this but never noticed because it was bugged)."
  - tweak: "You can now open storage containers with middle clicks as an alternative to drag and drop. Opening a storage container on a table or rack MUST be done using middle click."
  - tweak: "If you want items on a table listed you should use ALT click."
  - tweak: "To prevent people from accidentally flipping tables from muscle memory, you now need to be on harm intent to flip a table."
