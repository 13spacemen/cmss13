changes: 
  - experiment: "The first patch of the Xeno Rebalance is here. This is an experimental rebalance aimed at making younger tiers viable in combat, and making latter tiers less overwhelmingly strong. Nothing here is final and may change."
  - tweak: "Tier 1 Xenos have had their power curve lowered a little. Young Tier 1s are roughly equal to slightly better old Mature Tier 1s, with Ancients keeping their old strength - however, most of it has been trickled down to lower upgrades."
  - tweak: "Tier 2 Xenos have had their power curve lowered. Elder is now the peak strength, lower upgrades are about slightly better old Mature levels, and Ancient only gives you mutator points and an extra chevron."
  - tweak: "Tier 3 Xenos have also had their power curve flattened. Young Tier 3s are about midway from old Young to old Mature, while Matures retain full Mature T3 strength. Elder Tier 3s and Ancient Tier 3s now receive very slight bonuses to stats, and nothing major."
  - tweak: "The Queen keeps its old power curve and upgrade timer."
  - tweak: "Lurkers have been tweaked to do slightly less damage overall, with pounce delay being a little higher."
  - tweak: "Upgrade and evolve timers for tier ones have been halved. The time to upgrade to mature for tier twos has been halved."
  - experiment: "Tales tell of a new, dormant upgrade strain of Xenomorphs, surpassing even the old Ancients in strength..."
