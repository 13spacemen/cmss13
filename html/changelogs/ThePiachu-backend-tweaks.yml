# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - tweak: "Select Equipment works on non-humanoids (including observers). If used on a non-humanoid, it will turn them into a human first before applying a preset."
  - bugfix: "Cryo ERT marines should appear in the crew manifest."
  - tweak: "DEFCON's Cryo ERTs no longer announce a distress beacon, but spawn the same otherwise."
  - tweak: "Faction information is embedded into users' ID. Antag vendors on the admin level refer to that ID now. Future items might refer to that ID as well rather than using mind's faction. Setting up mobs for an event should be easier with this."
