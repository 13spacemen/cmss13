changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added tactical nuke option when reaching DEFCON 1. The tactical nuke can be deployed on the colony to wipe out any living thing from the mortal realm. With a set timer of 5 minutes (pending change), the xenomorphs will be alerted of its activation, and will be shown a pinpointer to its position. The Xenomorph Queen can diffuse the bomb by clicking on it, and this takes 15 seconds."
  - rscadd: "Tank crewmen have been re-enabled as roundstart crew. The tank vendor has been replaced with a tank part fabricator, which starts at 0 points. DEFCON rewards can grant the tank part fabricator points to build additional parts, and the tank only has access to the minigun turret and grenade launcher without this."
  - tweak: "Tank crewmen now have engineering skills to repair their own tank, as well as better leadership skills."
  - tweak: "DEFCON thresholds have been lowered overall."
  - rscadd: "Added the Intelligence Officer role, for gathering DEFCON intel and point scores throughout the round."
  - rscadd: "Added the data detector, a devide that is given to Intelligence Officers to detect objective items, such as intel, xeno corpses, devices, and disks."
  - tweak: "DEFCON objective values have been tweaked. You now actually recieve points for recovering xenomorph corpses."
  - tweak: "You no longer need the corresponding paper scrap to be able to interact with folders."
  - tweak: "Folders will now display their code in their names."
  - rscadd: "Added the Fulton recovery device, a 5-use item that allows you to send crates, unrevivable marines, dead xenomorphs, and other animals into orbit to be collected by the dropships. They are available from the marine vendors for 30 points, as well as given to Intelligence officers for free."
  - rscadd: "Added the Fulton recovery system, a new dropship hardpoint that can be used during transit (without requiring flyby). In order to use it, install the system and select it using the cockpit while in transit. Balloons set up by ground-side troops will only last 3 minutes, so pick your targets carefully!"
