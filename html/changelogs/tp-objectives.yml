# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.

changes: 
  - bugfix: "Initial xeno hosts don't count as 'survivors' for the sake of objective controller (aka we don't spawn a lot of expensive objectives and instantly fail them making DEFCON really hard)."
  - tweak: "Recovered corpses now stay recovered once they get to the morgue - you can cremate them as needed so you won't be forced to turn morgue slabs into clown cars on Prison Station ;)."
