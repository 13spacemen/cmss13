changes: 
  - experiment: "The company has provided a new state of the art machine to the Almayer Research Department, the Synthesis Simulator"
  - rscadd: "The Synthesis Simulator uses advanced algorithms to perform simulations of reagent properties, for the purpose of calculating the synthesis required to make a new variant of said chemical. This can be done with all research chemicals AND several default chemicals."
  - wip: "The Synthesis Simulator can currently only work with medicinal properties. Non-medicinal properties to follow."
  - rscadd: "Mixing Synthesized chemical variants with other variants of the same kind or with their original form, will react them back into the original."
  - rscadd: "The Synthesis Simulator runs using a new resource called research credits. Research credits are granted by identifying chemicals and defcon decreasing. More methods are to come."
  - rscadd: "Survivor doctor, survivor scientist and survivor liason now holds special id cards that can bypass clearance level requirements up to level 3, 4 and 5 respectively, regardless of defcon status. This can only be done by the actual card holder."
  - rscadd: "Added a research data terminal to the research study. This machine stores XRF scans and synthesis reports, and shows the status of research clearance and credits."
  - tweak: "Research clearance can now be increased using research credits at the research data terminal. You can still use a willing CL as a potential free shortcut though."
  - tweak: "Research clearance is now updated using the research data terminal instead of the XRF."
  - tweak: "Research clearance now starts at level 1."
  - tweak: "The XRF now prints the overdose threshold and potency of properties."
  - tweak: "Research chemicals are now scanable with the HF2."
  - tweak: "Research chemicals can no longer require synthetic blood as a component."
  - tweak: "The chemical report that the scientist survivor holds now contains more data."
  - tweak: "Research containment control consoles now require research access."
  - tweak: "Research laboratory no longer requires chemical access."
  - bugfix: "Chemistry backend received some cleanup. Debugging research chems and reactions should now be more consistent."
  - bugfix: "Fixed the access requirement for the east facing windoor at the research desk."
  - bugfix: "Fixed admin made chemicals having a default overdose threshold of 0."
