changes: 
  - bugfix: "Reduced latency overhead on Sorokyne Strata. Keep an eye on your ping, it should be about the same as other maps now."
  - bugfix: "Made sure survivors don't spawn next to Larva on Sorokyne Strata."
  - bugfix: "Added the Clown back to Sorokyne Strata."
  - bugfix: "Larva that spawn in the Deep Jungle Security Outpost should no longer be trapped until they mature."
  - rscadd: "The Tank (And eventually APC) are now enabled on Sorokyne, seeing as it is now Tank friendly. You need 100 readied players round start for it to spawn."
  - maptweak: "Greatly decongested Sorokyne Strata."
  - maptweak: "Removed nearly every platform in the way of primary combat lanes."
  - maptweak: "Increased all platform stair widths to minimum 3, with majority now being 5 wide."
  - maptweak: "Added new lanes connecting Sorokyne Medical to Sorokyne Administration."
  - maptweak: "Increased the width of the lane connecting Sorokyne Medical to the Aerodrome."
  - maptweak: "Removed needless holes and platforms in the Aerodrome."
  - maptweak: "Opened up Sorokyne Engineering and added enough generators to power the whole map. Backup generators still exist and can be powered."
  - maptweak: "Added some indestructable landmarks to the Sorokyne Deep Jungle, you should be getting lost a bit less."
  - maptweak: "Opened up the Personal Storage and Shower block on Sorokyne, it now connects to the North Wooden Hospital and Minehead, along with a new entrance to the Deep Jungle."
  - maptweak: "Opened up the areas around Sorokyne Administration so it's easier to navigate, or just cut past entirely."
  - maptweak: "Added connecting lanes from Sorokyne Security Hall to the Northern Pass and Administration."
  - maptweak: "Opened up the lanes leading into South LZ1. More changes to LZ1 and LZ2 pending."
  - maptweak: "Reduced the viability of moving through LZ2 Telecomms Maintenance, going through the snow and ice is a much faster route."
  - maptweak: "Removed a lot of in-the-way walls in the Jungle that over complicated pathing. Sightlines should be clearer, and defenses for Xenos more easily constructed."
  - maptweak: "Spread out all the Xeno spawns on Sorokyne, hopefully this will encourage new hive locations. Previously all Xenos spawned in a ring in the south of the map."
  - maptweak: "Opened up ice platforms and the base lanes in the Cryo-Thermal marshes, there should be more platform options, but they're not required to navigate the area anymore."
  - maptweak: "Opened up the Deep Jungle Security Outpost so it's more hive-viable. Added some secondary flanks to its chokepoints."
  - maptweak: "Added a new lane that leads into the North Passage and the Northern Basket Ball Court on Sorokyne."
  - maptweak: "Added extra data-terminals and and reduced the total amount of objective items to Sorokyne, this should make DEFCON easier."
  - maptweak: "Removed all the doors cutting the Aerodrome off from the rest of the map."
  - maptweak: "Added a new lane into the Canteen in the South, it leads directly to the upper decks. The previous lane was expanded, the kitchen is smaller as a result."
  - maptweak: "Widened the Administration back hall."
  - maptweak: "Added a new lane between south Administration to the South Canteen hall, this connects it directly to the Aerodrome."
  - maptweak: "Removed needless platforms and railings in Sorokyne Engineering lounge and foyer, it should be much easier to navigate."
  - maptweak: "Reduced Sorokyne from 256x256 to 256x190 tiles."
  - maptweak: "Snowstorms now have to wait 20 minutes between potentially happening instead of 4."
  - maptweak: "There are about a hundred other smaller changes, which are far too numerous to list. Happy Xeno hunting and Marine nesting."
