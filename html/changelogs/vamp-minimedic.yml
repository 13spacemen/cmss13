changes: 
  - tweak: "Autoinjectors have been changed. They now have 3 uses each and will inject exactly half the amount of the overdose limit. They have gotten a new sprite to reflect this new mechanic. Injectors that didnt fit into the new system has been removed."
  - tweak: "The skill required to open/use pill bottles have been upped a level. So only Squad Medics and up can do it now."
  - tweak: "Pill bottles have become slightly more expensive in the Squad Medic vendor to compete with autoinjectors."
  - tweak: "First Responder medical kit has been changed. It will now contain autoinjectors and less medical supplies. A special injector is supplied to mini-medics, but be careful when using it, its very easy to overdose. They gain a special MedHUD called Sensor HUD. This should move it more to self-reliance than replacing Squad Medics."
  - imageadd: "M56 Goggles now have their own sprite to differ them from UPP goggles."
  - imageadd: "Injector pouch has a new sprite and now has room for 7 injectors."
  - imageadd: "Some pouches may have gotten edgier, this is to create more consistency between pouches."
