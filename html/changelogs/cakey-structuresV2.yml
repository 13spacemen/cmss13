changes: 
  - rscadd: "Xenomorph Hive Structures have been added to the game. Special construction nodes can be built by builder castes, leaders, or the queen depending on the desired restriction set by the queen at any time. Most structures require special hive weeds to be built and require Plasmagas as a construction resource, which can be gathered and delivered to construction nodes by builder castes."
  - rscadd: "Added Plasmagas to the game. Plasmagas is a resource found on key locations of the map and can be gathered by both factions to give them advantages on the field."
  - rscadd: "Added hive collectors, built by the resin construction ability when targetting a resource node or a tile with a resource node present. Gathers 1 resource per 10 seconds and puts it into the hive resource pool."
  - rscadd: "Plasmagas nodes will span in three categories, Hive, LZ, and Primary nodes will spawn depending on events triggered during the round."
  - rscadd: "Hive resource nodes will appear after the first hive core has been built, selecting whichever node is closest to the hive position."
  - rscadd: "LZ resource nodes will appear next to whichever landing zone was picked by the marines at the start of the round, after the takeoff cooldown has passed."
  - rscadd: "Primary resource nodes will appear in central and key positions in the map, and will start appearing after 25 minutes have passed. Once a primary node has been depleted, depending on the player population, a new primary node will appear closer to whichever faction has gathered the least resources."
  - rscadd: "Added the ability to see resource node locations via the hive and command tacmaps."
  - rscadd: "Added the hive core, a hive structure that acts as a centrepiece to all hives by growing hive weeds and stockpiling Plasmagas."
  - rscadd: "Added the hive pylon, a remote structure that also grows hive weeds in a smaller radius as well as acting as a remote location from the hive to build hive structures and access the hive Plasmagas stockpile."
  - rscadd: "Hive pylons and cores will strengthen celings above them by 1 to 2 levels if the area they encompass is already rooved. This will stop air support from being effective around hive locations."
  - rscadd: "Added the spawn pool, a hive structure that can be fed bursted corpses in order to respawn a single xenomorph that was killed in action. Spawning can be disrupted by either killing the queen or destroying the pool."
  - rscadd: "Added the egg morpher, a hive structure that can be fed bursted corpses in order to generate a total of 6 facehuggers (per corpse) gradually without the need of an egg. Also fires at intruders in a larger radius than normal eggs."
  - rscadd: "Added the evolution pod, a hive structure that offers a bonus of 0.2 evolution per tick to all xenomorphs on weeds."
  - rscadd: "Added the recovery node, a hive structure that slowly recovers oen xenomorph at a time when resting adjacent to it."
  - rscadd: "Hives will now have a reduced rate of burrowed larvae after 25 minutes into the round. You will need to gain captures in order to efficiently grow your hive."
  - tweak: "Default monkey spawns have been reduced from 25 to 5. Extra monkies from survivor spawns have been removed."
  - tweak: "Young xenomorphs have been made significantly weaker. Later maturations have remained the same stat-wise."
  - rscdel: "Xenomorph acid splashback no longer stacks and has a cooldown applied before the next splashback can occur."
  - rscdel: "Multibursting has been removed."
