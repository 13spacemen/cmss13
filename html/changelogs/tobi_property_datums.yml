changes: 
  - experiment: "Reworked the chemical property system backend. All chemicals are now processed using properties, not just research chems. On the frontend chemicals should be basically unaffected by this, but some chemicals and some properties have still received minor tweaks as a result of the rework for the purpose of standardization."
  - rscadd: "Added the properties hemositic, thermostabilizing, focusing, cardiostabilizing, aiding, oxygenating, anticarcinogenic and ciphering. These are tied to specific chemicals and do do not spawn during random generation, but they can still be used with the simulator if so desired."
  - rscadd: "Also added the property electrogenetic, a common positive type."
  - rscadd: "Properties now have categories in addition to type and rarity, these are medicine, toxicant, stimulant, reactant, irritant, metabolite, and anomalous."
  - rscadd: "Research can now obtain clearance level X access at clearance level 5 for an additional 5 credits."
  - tweak: "The synthesis simulator now displays the property type."
  - tweak: "The boosting property now only affects properties that have an effect inside the body."
  - tweak: "Many chemicals have received slightly different overdose effects as these are tied to the properties."
  - tweak: "Overdosing on a painkiller now gives you +50% painkilling, plus the additional nasty overdose stuff."
  - tweak: "Synthesis targeting a rare property on relation mode now cost 3 times as much. Changing anomalous properties costs 10 times as much."
  - tweak: "Alkysine is no longer a painkiller."
  - tweak: "Halved the gain from the musclestimulating property per level."
  - tweak: "Having only positive properties in a chemical now increase all Synthesis Simulator operation costs by 1."
  - bugfix: "Fixed some inconsistency in how properties were combining."
  - bugfix: "CL setting clearance to max no longer decrease it when clearance has been bought #12239."
