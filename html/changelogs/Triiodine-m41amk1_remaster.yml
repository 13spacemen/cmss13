changes: 
  - imageadd: "The M41A MK1 has been redrawn and reshaded onto a universal palette. It no longer shares a sprite with the Trijent/WO variant of the M41A MK2. The back, suit, and hand states remain unchanged (for now)."
  - imageadd: "The M41A MK1 magazine has been given a new lore accurate sprite. It still shares 10x24mm despite the visual difference." 
  - imageadd: "M39 and M4A3 incendiary, AP, and extended ammunition have had their stripe standardized at the base of the magazine."
  - imageadd: "The M41A MK2 extended magazine stripes have been reshaded to better reflect the magazine shape."
  - tweak: "The M39 burst delay has been increased to compensate the new burst speed."
  - tweak: "The M41A MK1 can, at long last, proudly attach a rail light."
