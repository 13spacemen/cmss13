changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added the TC-4T portable telecommunications kit to the Almayer, found in the hangar south of the Alamo. Engineers can set this up colony-side in order to enable communications between the ground team and the Almayer. Requires a TC-4T circuit board, 2 cable coils, 2 power cells, 2 manipulators and 2 filters to set up. Can be damaged by xenomorphs and humans alike, and must be repaired using a welder."
  - maptweak: "Removed all functioning telecommunications from ground-side maps. Time to set up some dynamic FOB spots, marines!"
