changes: 
  - bugfix: "Fixing a ruptured/damaged lung will now actually stop you from suffocating in addition to allowing anesthetics to work during surgery. You DO NOT have to take off and put on anesthetic tanks after repairing a ruptured lung, your patient will take in the fumes on their own."
  - bugfix: "You can actually cancel out of evolution again using the 'Resist' verb. Other actions that would not properly cancel with resist will properly cancel again."
  - bugfix: "Being dragged through sticky resin will no longer stack movement delay to the point of making you a vegetable cripple."
