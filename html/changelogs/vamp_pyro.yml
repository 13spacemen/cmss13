changes: 
  - rscadd: "The USCM Pyrotechnician kit now spawns with a Broiler-T back harness. The M240-T cannot be used without it. However, it stores all three fuel types at the same time. The Broiler-T can be refueled by placing incinerator unit tanks into it. The current tank will be swapped out for the fresh one. The active fuel tank/type is visible as a HUD button in upper left. Pressing it will cycle M240-T munition type. The M240-T can also be stored inside the Broiler-T back harness, but it won't work with the auto-equip."
  - tweak: "The M240 and M240-T now display the loaded tank's percentage of remaining fuel after firing."
