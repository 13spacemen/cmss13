# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.

changes: 
  - tweak: "Nerfed OT rockets max power from 350 to 300 and OT mortars max power from 430 to 360. Both of these are still higher than the standard equivalent."
  - tweak: "Overhauled the falloff values of explosive chemicals. This value is now more important to the radius of the explosion than before."
  - tweak: "Default explosive chemicals can no longer be used with the synthesis simulator. The explosive property must be discovered through new chemicals."
  - tweak: "Reduced the max container size for OT rockets from 240 to 120."
