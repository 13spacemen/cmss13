changes: 
  - maptweak: "Did a bunch of small mapping tweaks around upper medbay."
  - maptweak: "Research lobby is now larger and has been merged with the test lab. There's now a chem station in the lobby. The old test lab is now called the Research Workshop."
  - maptweak: "Research now has one small containment cell and two medium containment cells. The last two can be merged into one large cell."
