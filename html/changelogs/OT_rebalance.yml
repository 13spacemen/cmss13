changes: 
  - tweak: "Chemical explosives now calculate falloff levels based on additives to a base falloff, rather than doing an average."
  - tweak: "Chemical explosives now have you trade between falloff and power, ANFO leaning towards the former and octogen leaning towards the latter. Cyclonite is in between."
  - tweak: "Bomb casings now use a maximum total volume of containers rather than a maximum individual container volume. The volume cap has been decreased to make it harder to make all-in-one bombs, so you have to choose a balance."
  - tweak: "The industry freezer will now max polymerize 3 containers at a time. Lowered how much paraformaldehyde is polymerized at a time in each container from 5 to 3."
  - tweak: "The following chemicals now alter fire color much more dramatically. Carbon, Copper, hydrogen, lithium, methane, oxygen, phoron, phosphorus, potassium-chloride, salt."
  - tweak: "Nerfed explosion wall bounce damage from a 0.9 to a 0.4 multiplier (Fourkhan)."
