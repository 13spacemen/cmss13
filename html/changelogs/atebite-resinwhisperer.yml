changes:
  - rscadd: A new Hivelord strain has been added - Resin Whisperer. This strain makes you give up the ability to make thick resin and decreases your plasma pool by 20%, but gives you a long range sight and the ability to place normal resin structures up to 13 tiles away
  - rscadd: A visual effect has been added to weeds when resin structures are being built on them
