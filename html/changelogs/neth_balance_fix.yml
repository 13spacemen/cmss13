changes: 
  - tweak: "Fixed armor being accounted two times during armor penetration calculation. The effect is 2x damage to armor on Crushers, less for less armored xenos. Damage to xeno armor will be bigger but... "
  - tweak: "Halved all damage to armor from armor piercing source. The armor reduction due to blocking actual damage is unchanged."
  - tweak: "If you are below 30% armor, you will regen armor 2 times slower until you reach 30%+"
  - tweak: "Increased speed of regen of xeno armor in general."
  - tweak: "Reduced flak AOE damage by about 30%."
  - tweak: "Bipod on M42A nerfed a bit."
  - imageadd: "Smartgunners now have two modes of fire. One that fires high Armor Breaking rounds with low damage and low accuracy, and second that fires no-AP high damage rounds that have 100% accuracy (most of the time). This is bound to unique-action."
  - tweak: "Smartgunners can toggle IFF by rightclicking on gun and toggling IFF. So please... don't shoot at others with IFF disabled. You literally can't do this on accident anymore."
