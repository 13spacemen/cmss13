changes: 
  - rscadd: "PFCs have been given "Kits". A Kit is a box that costs 45 kit points and will have a variety of items fitting a particular playstyle. Kits will be more cost effective than buying individual items from their vendor."
  - rscadd: "Current PFC Kits include mini-constructor, mini-engineer, mini-medic, mini-pyro and mini-sniper. Those are not nearly as potent as proper Engineers, Medics or Specs, but fulfill a similar role with more common items."
