      pouch.
  Stan_Albatross, Nauticall.:

  Geeves:
  - rscadd: Special ERT roles now have (5 hour) timelocks, the standard squaddie role
      for each ERT doesn't, so no one is prohibited from joining, just from getting
      special roles.
  - rscadd: Where ERTs previously had a probability to get either two SGs, one SG
      one spec, two specs, they will now always get one SG, one spec.
  - admin: Split the UPP Minigunner and UPP Shotgun Specialist into two different
      equipment roles.
  - bugfix: Fixed up some of the UPP backstory text.
  Jeser:
