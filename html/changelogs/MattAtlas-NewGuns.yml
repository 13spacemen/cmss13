changes: 
  - rscadd: "The M5A6 smartpistol has been added. It can be found in Requisitions vendors. This pistol fires IFF AP ammunition."
  - rscadd: "The M39 arm brace stock has been added. This stock makes one handing much better while making wielding much worse. It can be found in the Requisitions attachment vendor."
  - rscadd: "Light and Heavy armor types have been added to the PFC marine vendors. As you would expect, Heavy armor protects significantly more against melee and bullets, while also covering feet. Light armor protects less but you run faster."
  - bugfix: "PMCs should now actually have PMC IFF. That means the PMC sniper shouldn't hit them."
  - rscadd: "The smartpistol has its own unique belt that can also be gotten from Requisitions."
  - imageadd: "New PFC kit sprites courtesy of Triiodine."
