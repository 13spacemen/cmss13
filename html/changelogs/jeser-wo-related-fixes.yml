changes: 
  - bugfix: "Fixed Requisition vendors on Whiskey Outpost having wrong access requirements."
  - bugfix: "Fixed missing M39 Incendiary magazines in Req vendors on WO."
  - bugfix: "Fixed Dust Raiders squad marines on WO spawning without proper headsets."
  - bugfix: "Fixed Crew Manifest not showing WO-specific jobs."
  - tweak: "Slightly increased width of Crew Manifest window. Should prevent most of double lining due to long names and job titles."
  - tweak: "Set Marine Role Preferences window now will show actual WO job titles if opened on WO map and won't show regular jobs that don't have respective WO counterparts (SEA and Intelligence Officers currently). IMPORTANT: for preference saving system, these jobs are viewed as their regular counterparts, so saving character during WO will alter your regular job preferences accordingly."
  - tweak: "Lifted restriction on selecting strains on WO for xenomorphs."
  - maptweak: "Replaced two Type71 AP magazine boxes and SMG incendiary ammunition box with SMG extended magazine and SMG AP ammunition boxes."
