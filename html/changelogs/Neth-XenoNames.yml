changes: 
  - rscadd: "Xeno Identification is here:"
  - rscadd: "Xeno players can set up prefix and postfix of their number that will be constant between the rounds. Number is still random between respawns."
  - rscadd: "Xeno Id is displayed in game on mouseover (there is no easy way to hide this info from marines, so beware), in hivechat, localchat, LOOC and Hive Status."
  - rscadd: "Xeno Prefix can be 1-2 letters long and has to use capital letters. If no prefix is set, it will become 'XX' (like species name XX-121)."
  - rscadd: "Xeno Postfix consist of a single letter and an optional digit at the end. You can remove the Postfix, it's entirely optional."
  - rscadd: "When you posses a xeno body (by staff ckeying you in, or by Joining as Xeno into an SSD xeno body) it will gain your prefix and postfix but will retain old number."
  - tweak: "Xeno Queens lack any identification, their CKEY is shared at the end anyways and it doesn't fit the naming convention to give them prefixes/postfixes."
  - tweak: "You are free to change Xeno Id at any time, there is no 'lock' mechanic on any xeno-id."
