changes: 
  - rscadd: "Reworked the squad distribution computer so that almost anyone can be assigned to a squad. The only people who cannot be assigned to a marine squad are untrained civilians such as doctors. You must grab the person and click on the squad distribution computer to "scan" them in, and make sure they're standing next to the computer during the squad change/assignment."
  - tweak: "Self-examine is slightly more descriptive in very niche situations."
  - tweak: "You gain your original speed back much faster after being healed/getting surgery."
  - tweak: "Made 'Go to Lobby' the default option when you do not get your job. Make sure your prefs are set to the correct option."
  - tweak: "Made the M56D mount more resistant to explosions. Damage to melee will remain the same."
  - tweak: "The clunkiness when setting up the M56D has been reduced. You still need to place the mount and setup the M56D as you normally would before. However, once the M56D has been fully built, you don't have to keep placing the mount and then the M56D. Instead, mount remains attached to the M56D and you only have to setup it up and screwdriver M56D to set it up again at a different position. Sprites by Frans."
  - rscadd: "M56D mount can be constructed. First you need 5 plasteel (this is excuse for resistance to explosions). Then 10 metal and weld. Placeholder sprites for now."
  - tweak: "Motion detector can fit in armor slot now."
  - rscadd: "Humanoid mobs can no longer hurt others when on HELP intent. This includes shooting and melee. If there are any situations that I missed, report on Gitlab."
  - rscadd: "There is now a preference to disable NON-HELP intent actions on YOURSELF from going through. For example, if you keep PBing and you accidentally hit yourself during screenshake."
  - tweak: "Medic and engi vendors allow you to pick a vest instead of being constrained to webbing. Other specialized roles will still only get default webbing."
