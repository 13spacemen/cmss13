changes: 
  - experiment: "Ravager Rework plus two strains."
  - rscadd: "New Ravager has increased health, armour, but less speed and damage. This moves it more towards the intended front-line warrior akin to a Crusher. "
  - rscadd: "The Ravager now has a chance to embed shrapnel on hitting humans, the chance scales according to armour."
  - rscadd: "Ravager gains a guaranteed tail stab every 7 seconds. A tail stab is a normal attack that has a bit of armour penetration."
  - rscdel: "Tail stab armour penetration has been nerfed slightly."
  - rscdel: "Base Ravager no longer has a chance to delimb on hit."
  - rscdel: "Base Ravager can no longer charge."
  - rscdel: "Removed the strain Spin Slash"
  - rscadd: "Ravager Strain: Veteran. This is the old Ravager, sacrifices the new abilities, regains delimb and charge. Same stat wise."
  - rscadd: "Ravager Strain: Hedgehog. Loses the shrapnel embed and guaranteed tail stab. Gains two new abilities, first is Spin Slash, same as the old one. Second is Spike Spray, it flings out shrapnel towards the aimed direction and it does very little damage, but anyone hit is embedded with shrapnel and slowed for a short while."
  - tweak: "Shrapnel has been changed. If humans move while embedded, they will recieve brute damage to a body part. It is suggested they get rid of shrapnel fast."
  - rscadd: "Marines can now use their boot knife to remove shrapnel. Press Z in hotkey mode to use it and the equivalent in normal mode."
