  - rscadd: "Can repair automated closets, attachment vendor, and other similar vendors that were previously unrepairable."

  - rscadd: "If there are still leftovers (the new item is not the same type as the item in your inactive hand, there was too much of the new item, or either item was not stackable), then they will try to fill your active hand."

  - bugfix: "Cupola has working IFF again."
  - bugfix: "Empty HEFA box has a sprite again."
