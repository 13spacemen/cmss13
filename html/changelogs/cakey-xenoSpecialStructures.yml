changes: 
  - rscadd: "Xeno Special Structures have been added to the game. These can be built by builder castes by using the 'Resin Morph' ability, transforming your body into the selected structure."
  - rscadd: "Added the spawn pool, a xenomorph special structure, built by hivelords, can be fed bursted corpses in order to respawn a single xenomorph that was killed in action. Spawning can be disrupted by either killing the queen or destroying the pool."
  - rscadd: "Added the egg morpher, built by drones, carriers and hivelords, can be fed bursted corpses in order to generate a total of 6 facehuggers (per corpse) gradually without the need of an egg. Also fires at intruders. 2 per hive."
  - rscadd: "Added the evolution pod, built by drones, carriers and hivelords, can be consumed by non-larvae to max out evolution points. 5 per hive."
  - rscadd: "Hives will no longer gain free burrowed larvae after 25 minutes into the round. You will need to gain captures in order to grow your hive."
  - tweak: "Default monkey spawns have been reduced from 25 to 5. Extra monkies from survivor spawns have been removed."
  - tweak: "Young xenomorphs have been made significantly weaker. Later maturations have remained the same stat-wise."

  - rscdel: "Reduced xenomorph acid splashback damage."
