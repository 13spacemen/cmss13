  - tweak: "People with the ability to build metal cades can repair plasteel cades now."
  - rscadd: "Squad engis+ can wrench and then crowbar deployable cades to collapse them. This is faster than the normal method for collapsing."
  - rscadd: "Xeno Stat tab shows plasma count."
  - bugfix: "Sentries should no longer have issues shooting at targets. If issues persist, PM me on Discord and create a Gitlab."
  - bugfix: "Sentries don't try to shoot past emergency shutters now."
  - rscadd: "Can drag nanomed to yourself for an instant health scan."
  - bugfix: "Should no longer receive acid splash damage when devoured."

  - bugfix: "Crusher charge should deal damage to M56Ds now."
