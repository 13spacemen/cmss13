changes:
  - tweak: "NEW: You can't peek thru signal flares with obstructed roof (so either clear sky or glass roof). You still can fire using those flares but you have to go in blind or work with ground team. You still can follow the fire mission's shooting path without obstruction but only after you start shooting."
  - tweak: "NEW: Same for offset peeking. If tile is obstructed, your screen will go dark and you will receive a message. You still can execute Fire Missions."
  - tweak: "NEW: Signal Flares has to be ON THE GROUND to work. Not in hand or in backpack. If you pick signal flare mid flight, Fire Mission will be aborted."
  - tweak: "Above changes made to prevent queen killing in Ovipositor and some unfair air raids on spawn points. These changes do not completely remove it, they just make so that all parts of the marine forces has to cooperate to acheive game turning actions, and not just PO looking into every flare and jumping from offset to offset."
  - imageadd: "PO's can now return their dropship home at any point from a Fly-By mission by hitting "Abort". This sets the time left to land to 10 seconds."
  - imageadd: "PO's and Queen can now see how much time left to fly."
  - imageadd: "Most of the round start PO equipment was removed (excluding ammo and few attachments). Points were refunded."
  - imageadd: "Added signal flares to SL and PFC vendors. Those act as flares that can emit light for less time than normal flare (around 5 times less). However they provide constant signal (until they are snuffed out or melted) to the PO and can be used instead of laser."
  - imageadd: "Signal Flare Packs can be bought from the Req."
  - imageadd: "Laser and Laser battery are made cheaper but they hit smaller AOE. Right now they are PERFECT weapon for Strafing Runs but be sure to spread shots, as different lasers hitting same spot is sub-optimal."
  - imageadd: "Installing a fuel enhancer will allow you to fly longer during Fly-By's."
  - experiment: "Fire Mission Mode:"
  - imageadd: "PO's can set up Fire Missions - basically strafing runs on the surface of the planet."
  - imageadd: "Everyone in the radius of actual Strafing Run location are warned by loud sonic boom. Sonic boom has BIG radius, YOU ARE WARNED. But run and hide in any case."
  - imageadd: "Fire Missions should be created after all of the combat equipment has been installed on the dropship, including ammunition."
  - imageadd: "In Fire Mission editor you can set up how mission itself plays out and with what offsets from the center (called GIMBAL). Do note, that all gimbals are relative to the direction of the strafing run, so if you do a strafing run south, left will be on the screen's right and vice versa"
  - imageadd: "While preparing for the Strafing Run you can peek thru the optical scope and see the situation planetside, change direction of the run and offset on that direction. You DO NOT NEED any additional attachments to do this."
  - imageadd: "You can continue peeking thru the optical scope and see how your Fire Mission resolves in real time. That lets you trully feel the Xeno salt... or in case of FF Strafing Run... oh boy."
  - imageadd: "If any error happens during Fire Mission setup, watch the chat for messages."
  - imageadd: "Every weapon has a delay in Fire Mission set up, so you can't fill every fire segment. Again, watch the chat for hints if you use incorrect cooldowns."
  - imageadd: "GAU has a delay of 2. So you can do "Fire-Wait-Fire"."
  - imageadd: "Mini-rockets has a delay of 3. So you can do "Fire-Wait-Wait-Fire"."
  - imageadd: "Laser has a delay of 4. So you can do "Fire-Wait-Wait-Wait-Fire"."
  - imageadd: "Big rockets have no delay but they only have one rocket."
  - imageadd: "FATTY AND NAPALM ROCKETS CANNOT BE FIRED DURING CAS RUNS."
  - imageadd: "Fire Mission has to have ZERO errors for it to be run-able. If Fire Mission stops abruptly, it's probably because it has error now (most likely "no ammo"). You have to have enough ammo for ALL of the strafing run. If you see numbers in yellow in the Fire Mission setup, that means you won't have enough ammo for SECOND strafing run. If numbers are red - you don't have enough ammo RIGHT NOW."

  - imageadd: "Better manual will be soon. So for now some rounds will have a PO Instructor Character explaining it ICly."
  - imageadd: "Interface sucks, but oh well, it's NanoUI."
  - imageadd: "There could be some bugs with you being able to target caves, but note that even tho you CAN target them and WILL fire at them, nothing will happen and you will waste ammo."
