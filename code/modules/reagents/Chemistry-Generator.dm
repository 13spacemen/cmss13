			CHEM_CLASS_COMMON           2 Chemicals that can be vended directly or have a very simple recipe (bicardine, ammonia, table salt)
			CHEM_CLASS_UNCOMMON         3 Chemicals which recipe is uncommonly known and made (spacedrugs, foaming agent)
			CHEM_CLASS_RARE             4 Chemicals without a recipe but can be obtained on the Almayer, or requires rare components
			CHEM_CLASS_SPECIAL          5 Chemicals without a recipe and can't be obtained on the Almayer, or requires special components
		gen_tier						Determines how many properties a generated chemical gets, the chance of the properties being good/negative, and how rare the required reagents are
		potency							Determines how strong the paired property is. Is an associative variable to each property
