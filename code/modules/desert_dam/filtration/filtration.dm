/*
So, how will we do this?
Global river status var, maybe


Each var depends on others


var/global/riverend_west = 0
var/global/riverend_north = 0
var/global/river_central = 0
var/global/cannal = 0
var/global/dam_underpass = 0
var/global/south_river = 0
var/global/south_filtration = 0
var/global/east_river = 0
var/global/east_filtration = 0
var/global/south_riverstart = 0
var/global/east_riverstart = 0

/proc/filtration_check()
	if(east_filtration)
